This report is compiled on the basis of common specifications which were prepared by EU Member States and the European Commission. 
Common specifications for all EU Member States and Norway enable comparability of national reports and their subsequent use for the Europeanwide EMN annual report and other outputs at EU level. 
The report has two forms: Part 1, which is prepared for the European Commission and is not publicly available, and Part 2, which as a publication serves Member States. 
The report includes also national statistics which are not collected at EU level (through Eurostat or Frontex). 
In terms of methodology, the report uses secondary research and has a descriptive nature. 
The report for Slovakia is based on available expert publications, statistics, legislation, Slovakia's political documents, internet sources and media monitoring1. 
Significant sources of information were reference documents and information obtained from the following state administration bodies: MoI SR (namely BBAP PFP, MO MoI SR, Department of Foreign and European Affairs of the Office of the Minister of Interior, Information Centre for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Crime Prevention of the MoI SR and FAD EPS MoI SR), MoLSAF SR, COLSAF (through MoLSAF SR), MoFEA SR, Ministry of Justice of the SR (through FAD EPS MoI SR) and IOM. 
Materials, publications, and websites of other state, European, international and non-governmental institutions also represent important sources of information. 
The report also refers to several EMN publications and activities. 
Each chapter uses also media releases as sources of information. 
The text therefore contains links to media references to migration topics and activities carried out by public administration, nongovernemntal sector and international organisations. 
The report was compiled by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Bratislava which is the coordinator of the EMN National Contact Point for the Slovak Republic (SR). 
Terms and Definitions 
The expert terms used in this report largely correspond with the definitions in the EMN Migration and Asylum Glossary. 
2 In case the definitions from this Glossary cannot be used for some terms, the terms are used pursuant to the national or EU legislation (regulations, directives). 
Available at: http://ec.europa.eu/ dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/glossary/index_a_en.htm (consulted on 02/04/2016). 
According to the EMN Glossary, an alien (foreigner), in the EU context, is a person who is not a national of an EU Member State, and, in the global context, a person who is not a national of a given State. 
The Slovak legislation, however, defines an alien who is not a national of an EU Member State as third-country national4. 
In this report, the term alien (foreigner) is therefore mainly used in texts and statistics which relate or are kept in compliance with the national legislation. 
The term migrant is also used in the report, which, unlike the definition in the EMN Glossary5 , is used as a synonym of the words alien or third-country national.

Executive Summary 
The report describes changes, developments and activities at the legislative, institutional, political and practical levels from 01 January 2015 till 31 December 2015, and puts them into the context of EU policies and legislation. 
The report describes general political and policy developments and discussions on migration, and deals with legal migration and mobility, international protection including asylum, unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups, combating trafficking in human beings, migration and development, irregular migration including smuggling, and returns. 
In the annex, the report presents also selected statistics which are not collected at EU level. 
In 2015, the freshly begun parliamentary election campaign of political parties formed an important part of the political and public life in Slovakia. 
Since the second half of the year forced and irregular migration dominaed the pre-election discussions, specifically in relation to the situation and developments in the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the EU, as well as to policies and measures of the EU and its Member States in this regard. 
Since the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic in 1993, migration issues has become for the first time ever part of election debates and public meetings, pre-election public opinion surveys and election programmes of political parties. 
Unlike in the past, migration and international protection topics largely resonated not only in the political, but also in the media and social contexts. 
Migration was one of the most covered topics by media in Slovakia, and the public debate on persisting mixed migration into Europe was joined by the non-governmental sector, but also by the civil society. 
No organisational nor institutional changes within the key state administration bodies occurred in Slovakia in the field of migration and international protection in 2015. 
Under the Steering Committee for Migration and Foreigners' Integration, a working group for asylum with focus on the integration of beneficiaries of international protection was established, and under the Government Council for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality a working group on refugee and migrant rights was set up. 
Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and Internal Security Fund replaced the Programme Solidarity and management of migration flows in the budget period 2014 - 2020. 
In 2015, Slovakia amended the Act on Asylum mainly with respect to vulnerable groups of migrants, Act on Residence of Aliens, and adopted new Act on Development Cooperation. 
Amon strategic documents which were approved by the Slovak Republic, were National Border Control Management Plan of the Slovak Republic 2015 - 2018 and National Strategy for Protection and Promotion of Human Rights in the Slovak Republic which identified migrants as such as a vulnerable group. 
Based on the Strategy, Action Plan on Prevention of All Forms of Discrimination 2015 2019 was elaborated and adopted. 
No substantial changes occurred in 2015 with respect to the labour market policy compared to 2014. 
At present, Slovakia focuses on carrying out analyses and prognoses on scarce jobs, based on which a list of scarce professions (i.e. professions which cannot be filled with the domestic 
In the field of international protection, the period after the expiry of which asylum seekers are free to access the labour market was reduced from one year to nine months without the need to obtain the work permit. 
Amended the Act on Asylum also established procedure for identifying needs of vulnerable persons ("social profile"). 
In 2015, Slovakia began preparing the first state integration programme for persons with granted international protection, and provided temporary accommodation facilities in Gabčíkovo to asylum seekers in Austria. 
Slovakia continued with humanitarian transfers through its territory as part of resettlement of refugees and persons under UNHCR protection to countries of permanent resettlement, while having increased the capacity of the transit centre from 150 to 250 persons. 
Slovakia also carried out ad-hoc humanitarian admission of 149 internally displaced persons from northern Iraq and discussed the possibilities of co-operation with the first voluntary initiative in the field of integration of persons with granted international protection. 
In 2015, 330 asylum applications were lodged, including 271 first-time applications. 
In the same year, Slovakia granted 8 asylums and 41 subsidiary protections; decided to abort the procedure in 148 cases; refused to grant asylum in 70 cases and subsidiary protection in 41 cases. 
In 2015, the most numerous groups of asylum seekers were applicants from Iraq, Afghanistan and Ukraine. 
Certain legislative amendments which were adopted in 2015 dealt with unaccompanied minors (UAMs) under the asylum procedure and their stay in the foster home for UAMs. 
Unaccompanied minors can stay in the facilities under the social and legal protection of children and social guardianship also during the asylum procedure so they will not be moved to the asylum facilities of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic for this purpose. 
Slovakia did not record increased numbers of UAMs also in 2015. 
A total of 23 UAMs were apprehended, almost half of them being nationals of Afghanistan. 
In 2015, 26 UAMs, mostly males, were placed in the foster home for UAMs in Medzilaborce. 
Strategic documents concerning irregular migration in Slovakia in 2015 is the new National Border Control Management Plan of the Slovak Republic 2015 - 2018 and the Schengen Action Plan of the Slovak Republic which is regularly updated. 
In connection with the migration situation into the EU, in 2015 Slovakia did not launch any temporary border controls and did not report increased pressures on its external border. 
In September 2015, Slovakia only implemented temporary measures at the Slovak-Austrian and Slovak-Hungarian border crossing points which responded to temporary border controls by Germany at its borders with Austria. 
Slovakia recorded low irregular migration also in 2015: cases of irregular state border crossing were detected in a similar range as in the previous year, however, the number of detected cases of unauthorised stays in Slovakia was twice as high as in 2014. 
Overall, 2,535 cases of irregular migration were detected in 2015, of which 867 cases concerned Ukrainian nationals, 582 Syrian nationals, 265 nationals of Afghanistan and 146 Iraqi nationals. 
In February 2015, the Slovak Government approved the National Programme for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings2015 -2018 which includes also the National Action Plan for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings. 
ing assistance and support to victims of human trafficking. 
The number of identified foreign, i.e. third-country victims of human trafficking in Slovakia has been low in the long-term. 
Like in the previous year, one victim of human trafficking, who was a third-country national, was recorded in 2015. 
In 2015, Slovak Republic did not implement special activities or systemic measures to support the development impact of migration. 
Slovakia focused especially on changing the mechanism of providing official development assistance and given the developments in forced and irregular migration into the EU, humanitarian aid and voluntary contributions to international organisations and EU funds have become one of the key activities of Slovakia's development cooperation. 
In November 2015 Slovakia approved new Act on Development Cooperation with effect from 01 January 2016 which replaces Act on Development Aid from 2007.

02. Overview of Political Developments in the Field of Migration and Asylum 
Overview of Political Developments in the Field of Migration and Asylum 
Unlike in the past, migration and international protection issues largely resonated not only in the political, but also in the media and social contexts. 
Migration was one of the most covered topics in Slovakia, and the public debate on persisting mixed migration into Europe was joined not only by the non-governmental sector, but also by the civil society. 
2.1 General Political and Institutional Developments 
The year 2015 was the pre-election year before parliamentary elections held in March 2016. 
The topics which prevailed in election debates from the second half of the year included forced and irregular migration in connection with the situation and developments in the Mediterranean, the Balkans and in the EU, as well as the policies and measures of the EU and its Member States in this field. 
A 
borders (Sloboda a solidarita13, Slovenská národná strana14, Obyčajní ľudia a nezívislé osobnosti15, Slovenská demokratická a kresťanská únia - Demokratická strana, Sme Rodina - Boris Kollár), the enhancement of Slovakia's security (Smer - sociálna demokracia, Slovenská národná strana, Sme Rodina - Boris Kollár), the rejection of mandatory refugee quotas (Sme rodina - Boris Kollár16), the setting-up of reception centres in transit countries outside the Schengen Area (Sloboda a solidarita, Obyčajní ľudia a nezávislé osobnosti), increased official development aid of Slovakia (Obyčajní ľudia a nezávislé osobnosti), support of transit countries, and the addressing of the situation in the source countries of migrants (Sieť, Obyčajní ľudia a nezávislé osobnosti). 
All parliamentary political parties in Slovakia publicly rejected mandatory quotas for refugees and highlighted the need to protect the external borders of the Schengen Area. 
2.2 Migration in the Political, Media and Social Contexts 
Political and Policy Discussion 
Unlike in previous years, migration and international protection issues became the subject in 2015 of several discussions in Parliament and in the Government, including in the Security Council of the SR. 
The situation was also commented on by the President of the SR18 and the ombudsman19 several times. 
Regarding inter-sectoral co-operation and coordination in migration issues, the following committees continued pursuing their activities: 
20 • Inter-Ministerial Expert Committee for Labour Migration and Foreigners' Integration (MEKOMIC)21, whose meeting on 9 December 2015 was devoted to implementation of action plans related to Integration Policy of the Slovak Republic and Resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic from 21 October 201522 adopted in result of so called migration crisis, specifically in relation to prepaparation of state integration programme for the beneficiaries of international protection (see chapter 3.5). 
The Committee discussed also current status of AMIF whose national program was adopted on 29 July 2015 and the last meeting of National Contact Points for Integration (NCPI).23 
In relation to the civic initiative Plea for Humanity (see below) and developments in the European context, MoFEA SR began to hold regular meetings of state authorities and non-governmental organizations at the level of its State Secretary. 
These meetings were looking for ways to engage as good as possible all actors including the local ones into integration of migrants from third countries in need of international protection. 
To support policy creation at the level of the EU and its Member States, Slovakia was involved in 2015 in the activities of the European Migration Network (EMN)25. 
The activities of the EMN National Contact Point for the SR26, such as publications27, ad-hoc queries28, a national conference (in 2015, on Integration Programmes for Beneficiaries of International Protection with a subsequent EMN Expert Roundtable), a training seminar (in 2015, on Irregular Migration - Borders and Human Rights) and other expert meetings,29 tackled various topics concerning migration of TCNs each year, and are designed for the representatives of state and public administration, research institutions and the academic and non-governmental sectors. 
In 2015, the MoI SR, in coordination with the MoFEA SR, continued with preparations for Slovakia's first presidency ever of the Council of the EU in the second half of 2016.31 Mixed migration flows and international protection issues are priorities also of the 18-month programme of the Council which covers the period of three upcoming presidencies: that of the Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta. 
Among its members are experts of central state administration bodies which pursue the aims and implement the measures of the Integration Policy. 
If needed, MEKOMIC meetings are attended by international and non-governmental organisations.

25 The EMN provides up-to-date, objective, reliable and comparable information on migration and international protection to the EU and its Member States to support their policymaking. 
The EMN acitvities are implemented through the National Contact Points in all EU Member States and Norway in coordination with the European Commission (DG Migration and Home Affairs). 
EMN activities are focused on migration of thirdcountry nationals. 
26 The EMN National Contact Point for the Slovak Republic consists of the MoI SR, the MoLSAF SR, the SO SR, and the IOM as its coordinator.

34 The programme of the six-month Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU, which will define the presidency's priorities, will be approved by the Slovak Government in June 2016.35 
Public Debates, Public Opinion and Civic Activism 
With respect to the deteriorating situation in the field of forced and irregular migration in the Mediterranean, two spontaneous civic initiatives were launched in 2015 which, apart from a declaratory level, gradually presented practical activities to support migrants coming to Europe. 
In April, the initiative Who Will Help If Not Us (see sub-section 5.5) appealed to the Slovak Government to admit 100 refugee and displaced families from Syria and Iraq, and launched registration of volunteers for integration assistance to persons under international protection (the initiative had over 2,000 registrations by the end of the year).36 The initiative Plea for Humanity was launched as a reaction to the death of 71 migrants near Parndorf37 in August 2015, and aimed to raise broader public interest in the tragic situation faced by people escaping from war, and called upon the Slovak Government to convene a roundtable of all stakeholders who can contribute to the mitigation of the consequences of the greatest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. 
41 Slovak volunteers were also actively involved in projects other than the ones supported under this scheme - in the Balkans, Hungary and Austria. 
In June 2015, on the occasion of World Refugee Day, a group of 16 non-governmental organisations supporting the admission of migrants intervened in the public debate with an official letter calling upon the Slovak Government to join the European Migration Agenda, including admission of the most vulnerable refugees and opening of legal channels for the arrival of asylum seekers. 
including works on the future development of the Common European Asylum System, efforts in the field of relocations and resettlements, returns and readmissions, border management, enhanced fight against smuggling and other activities concerning legal migration. 
35 Information provided by the MoFEA. 
As a reaction to the Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Interior SR and Austria on Temporary Accommodation of Asylum Seekers who have applied for asylum in Austria (see 4.3), a local referendum was held in Gabčíkovo. 
The referendum was organised on the basis of a petition and aimed to explore the opinion on the opening of a temporary asylum facility in this municipality. 
Out of 2,603 voters who cast their vote, 96.67% voted against the opening of the asylum facility. 
50 Since the local referendum is not binding for state authorities, the Mol SR went ahead on opening the accommodation facility. 
Several public opinion polls were conducted in Slovakia in 2015 on issues related to migration and international protection. 
According to these opinion polls, Slovak citizens mostly had a negative attitude towards mandatory quotas and the admission of refugees to the Slovak territory in general, which was relatively independent from supporting any political party (government or opposition ones).52 The opinion poll from the end of 2015 can serve as illustration; according to this poll, 38.8% of Slovak respondents did not perceive any event in 2015 on the domestic or foreign political scene as positive. 
Migration in the Mass Media 
53 This was followed by the terrorist attacks in Paris (19.4%), persistent corruption (13.3%), unemployment (12.8%), the invitation for migrants to come to the European Union by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (12.5%) or the government activities (8.4%). 
55 The unsorted version of media monitoring for 2015 contains 61,908 news reports. 
The monitoring includes a small percentage of irrelevant or marginal press articles. 
56 Information provided by the IOM. 
The mass media mainly tackled the situation in the Mediterranean, Greece, Italy, Balkan transit countries and Hungary. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2015 
Slovakia continued with humanitarian transfers through its territory in the framework of resettlement of refugees and persons under UNHCR protection into countries of permanent resettlement, having increased the capacity of the transit centre from 150 to 250 persons. 
Slovakia also carried out ad-hoc humanitarian admission of 149 refugees from northern Iraq and discussed the possibilities of co-operation with the first voluntary initiative in the field of integration of persons under international protection. 
The number of asylum applications in Slovakia has been small for a long period of time. 
Since Slovakia's entry into the Schengen Zone at the end of 2007, the number of asylum applications did not exceed one thousand, and is on the decline58. 
Compared to the previous year, 
In 2012, there were 222 applicants from Somalia; their number dropped to 57 in 2013 and to 19 in 2014, and in 2015 there were four asylum seekers from Somalia. 
3.1 Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and Legislative Changes 
• The cases of lodging subsequent applications were reviewed. 
• A new criterion was added for designating a country a safe country of origin or a safe third country;64 
• The identification of the need for special procedural guarantees for asylum seekers and a special procedure against such applicants was introduced. 
Under Article 39 of the Act on Asylum, the MoI SR is required to create appropriate conditions for the accommodation of aliens in

asylum facilities, while taking into account the special needs of vulnerable persons identified on the basis of an individual assessment of their condition. 
• The period after the expiry of which asylum seekers have the right to access the labour market was reduced from one year to nine months; 
• The obligation to attend trainings for the staff of the Ministry of Interior and members of the Police Force was introduced; 
• The reasons for suspending the procedure on cancellation of temporary shelter were defined; 
In addition, this provision introduced the obligation of the authorised ministry staff to enable the applicant's representative to give opinion on the interview;66 
However, in both cases, the possibilities of the ministry are taken into account;

Unlike the previous legal condition, the factual situation at the time of declaration or issue of the decision is decisive for the court with respect to the assessment of the legality of the decision on asylum or subsidiary protection. 
In 2015 no relevant institutional changes took place in Slovakia. 
Dublin procedure 
Country of Origin Information 
Regarding search, processing and provision of information on the countries of origin of asylum seekers, the Migration Office focused in 2015 on the compilation of Q&As for case workers. 
Over 300 Q&As were prepared in total. 
In its activities, the MO complied with the national and EU legislation and with the still applicable Internal Guideline of the Director of the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic laying down the procedure for the submission of questions and the processing of information on the countries of origin of asylum seekers (2010). 
Vulnerable groups 
It is a kind of a social profile which also specifies the level of vulnerability and related special needs of the person. 
Besides procedural department staff, the applicant's situation is also assessed by social workers, nurses, physicians, a psychologist and other persons from non-profit organisations and projects who come into contact with the given person. 
The social profile is used to assess the overall condition of the applicant not only on the basis of factors such as sex, age, health condition, pregnancy, illiteracy, incomplete family, or information whether the person became a victim of violence, torture, etc., but also behaviour among other applicants and other family members within the facility, the applicant's behaviour in conflict situations, the applicant's ambitions and interests, involvement in various activities and attitudes to work, and compliance with rules. 
Such assessment facilitates the work of social workers and of those responsible for integration, and, understandably, the fulfilment of the applicant's specific needs. 
With the exception of the social profile, we do not record any changes in the reception of applicants and related measures in the field of accommodation or access to healthcare. 
Applicants are first placed in the Reception Centre in Humenné, which also serves as a quarantine facility, and later in the Accommodation Centre in Opatovská Nová Ves in the case of women, families with children and elder people, or to Rohovce in the case of male individuals. 
The state provides healthcare to such persons. 
Once reaching full age, unaccompanied minors can

71 According to this amendment, such contribution is also granted to UAMs who were placed in a foster home and reached full age. 
Return of rejected asylum applicants 
The provisions of the Act on Residence of Aliens and the Act on Asylum concerning the enforcement of decisions on the administrative expulsion of rejected asylum applicants changed; under the amended provisions, such decision can in special cases be enforced immediately after issuing a decision on non-granting asylum and, in special cases, it is necessary to wait for the final decision on non-granting asylum (lodging an appeal against a decision on non-granting asylum). 
This legislative change is due mainly to the transposition ofithe new Reception Directive into the Slovak national legislation. 
Resettlement 
In 2015, Slovakia did not carry out any resettlements under the EU Joint Resettlement Programme. 
External dimension 
In co-operation with the Czech Republic, Slovakia organised national training courses on the modules Inclusion (25 participants) and Interview Technique (16 participants) for the staff of the MO MoI SR. 
Both national training courses were attended by the staff of the Procedural Department of the MO MoI SR and their Czech colleagues from the MoI CR. 
Slovakia was involved in the preparation of several COI reports, namely in the position of codrafter in updating the reports on Somalia (Somalia Security Update), in the position of researcher in updating the report on Afghanistan (Security Update), and in the position of reviewer on the Syria factsheet for Greece and Bulgaria. 
In addition, a Seconded National Expert was directly posted to the EASO unit dealing with information on countries of origin from December 2013, terminating his activities in August 201573. 
3.3 Intra-EU Solidarity Including Relocations 
In 2015, as an expression of solidarity with the most burdened EU Member State as a result of the large numbers of incomingmigrants, Slovakia provided to Austria temporary accommodation capacities for persons who applied for asylum in Austria for the period of their asylum procedure. 
74 Temporary assistance began to be provided on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Slovakia and Austria on 21 July 2015 for a period of two years. 
According to this Memorandum, maximum 500 asylum seekers can be accommodated in the facility - special facility of the Slovak University of Technology in Gabčíkovo - at the same time. 
Slovakia provides to "Austrian" asylum seekers accommodation and food, and the Austrian Ministry of Interior has its social workers in Gabčíkovo. 
The regime in the facility is free. 
The new Council decisions on relocations began to be implemented mainly in the 2nd half of 2015, with EASO playing one of the key roles with respect to the coordination and secondment of experts from EU Member States to assist in Italy and Greece. 
• Mapping mission in Hungary focusing on the study of compliance of the Hungarian asylum system with European and international standards, March 2015; and 
• in Bulgaria in the framework of a support programme in the field of reception and social activities, September - October 2015.75 
In 2015, Slovakia did not participate in any relocation programme, and no applicant for international protection was relocated to the Slovak territory (see Table 7 in the Annex). 
Slovakia was actively involved in negotiations on relocation decisions, appointed a national contact point in line with the European Commission's requirements, as well as liaison officers for Greece and Italy. 
3.4 Enhancing the External Dimension Including Resettlement 
In 2015, Slovakia did not carry out any resettlement activities on the basis of the EU resettlement scheme or in co-operation with the UNHCR. 
Slovakia is involved in resettlement activities solely on a voluntary ad-hoc basis, and is currently not planning to participate in the EU Joint Resettlement Programme. 
All resettled persons are Iraqi nationals. 
The costs of the integration of refugees into society are covered from funds provided by foreign donors and from state funds allocated in the state budget. 
In 2015, Slovakia continued carrying out humanitarian transfers through its territory as part of the resettlement of refugees and persons under UNHCR protection to third countries - countries of permanent resettlement - and provided temporary shelter to another 98 refugees. 
A great part of them were Somali families with children, and the rest were refugees from Ethiopia and Sudan. 
During their stay in the Emergency Transit Centre (ETC) in Humenné, Slovakia provides to these persons comprehensive services, accommodation, food and basic sanitary needs. 
Healthcare and social care is provided to refugees by the UNHCR. 
The IOM is responsible for the transport of refugees from the refugee camp to Slovakia and from Slovakia to the country of resettlement, for the conducting of security interviews, medical examinations, vaccination and cultural orientation courses. 
In 2015, 146 refugees who arrived in the ETC in 2014 and 2015 were resettled, all of them having been received by the USA. 
Most families resettled in 2015 were Somali families with children. 
Slovakia is one of the two countries in the world (along with Romania) which help refugees in this manner. 
The IOM as the EMN coordinator in Slovakia, in co-operation with the MO MoI SR which was in charge of the preparation of the programme, organised the EMN national conference Integration Programmes for Persons under International Protection in Bratislava at the beginning of December 2015 and a follow-up Expert Roundtable. 
Among conference speakers, there were representatives of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), the state administration of the Visegrad Group countries, and national experts in this field.

81 The current agreement on humanitarian transfer was signed on 07 October 2015 and is in effect until 31 December 2017. 
The situation was subsequently addressed through an integration project which was financed from state budget funds until the end of November 2015 by means of public procurement and was implemented by the Slovak Catholic Charity. 
Since 01 December 2015, the integration project has been implemented from finances by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF). 
Willingness to join the process of integration of persons under international protection was for the first time manifested in Slovakia by volunteers gathering under the civic initiative Who Will Help If Not Us. This initiative was founded in April 2015, and called upon the Slovak Government to receive 100 refugee and displaced persons from Syria and Iraq. 
The statistics is provided in Table 9 in the Annex. 
Unaccompanied Minors and Other Vulnerable Groups 
In 2015, certain legislative amendments were adopted concerning, in particular, unaccompanied minors under the asylum procedure and the stay of UAMs in the foster home for UAMs. 
The amendment to the Act on Asylum also introduced a procedure for the identification of the special needs of vulnerable persons. 
Migrants as such were identified as a vulnerable group in the National Strategy for the Protection and Support of Human Rights in Slovakia89, approved by the Slovak Government on 18 February 2015.90 
The AMIF activities, aimed to provide services to third-country nationals, will also seek to satisfy the needs of vulnerable groups of persons. 
Since the needs of the vulnerable groups of persons have a cross-cutting nature, as of 2016, these needs will be satisfied under the priorities of the specific objectives of the AMIF National Programme. 
4.1 Unaccompanied Minors 
Slovakia did not record increased numbers of UAMs, not even in 2015. 
A total of 23 UAMs were apprehended upon illegal state border crossing and illegal stay in Slovakia, almost half of them 
91 Information provided by the FAD EPS MoI SR. 
Unaccompanied minors stay in SPCSG facilities also during the asylum procedure94. 
This means that they would not be moved to the asylum facilities of the MoI SR for this purpose. 
This amendment thus takes into account the interests of a minor to a larger extent, and fully complies with the respective applicable directive. 
• Provision of a contribution to facilitate the independence of the unaccompanied minor who was placed in a foster home and reached full age; 
• The obligation of the foster home to create conditions for the meeting of unaccompanied minors with representatives of international organisations; 
• The obligation of the foster home to inform the MoI SR that a minor who applied for asylum left the foster home without consent. 
The transposition of these directives means the end of the 2nd phase of building the Common European Asylum System. 
The amendment to the Act on Asylum also amends the Code of Civil Procedures, the Act on Social Protection of Children and Social Guardianship, the Act on Residence of Aliens, and the Act on Provision of Legal Assistance to persons in Material Need. 
The Bakhita IV project (see sub-section 5.5.6), implemented by the Slovak Catholic Charity, follows up on the previous projects of this organisation, which focused on work with minor refugees. 
The project ensured psychological, pedagogical and social counselling to UAMs in the Foster Home and Children's Centre in Medzilaborce, concentrating on their optimal psychosocial development and adaptation in an unfamiliar environment. 
The expert team consisted of a psychologist, a social counsellor, and a teacher. 
The task of the psychologist was to analyse the psychological needs and to conduct therapy to mitigate the bad psychological conditions of UAMs. 
The teacher was responsible for Slovak language teaching in an appropriate form. 
The organising of cognitive and educational activities was the role of the social counsellor. 
The project Legal counselling on residence and citizenship 5 (see sub-section 5.5.6), implemented since July 2014, followed up on the project of the Human Rights League with the same title, which, among others, focused on legal assistance and counselling to UAMs. 
98 In addition, brochures in several language versions are published for this category of migrants. 
4.2 Other Vulnerable Groups 
• Identification of the special needs of vulnerable persons (e.g. minors, disabled persons, pregnant women, victims of trafficking in human beings, etc.). 
Their needs will be taken into account in the creation of appropriate conditions for accommodation and care.

101 Information provided by the MO MoI SR. 
In order to increase participation of the most vulnerable persons and persons exposed to threats, including participation in the labour market, the COLSAF prepared for the new programming period a national project Supporting the integration of foreigners in facilities for social protection of children and social guardianship. 
The target groups are a) children, adult individuals and families who are subject to measures of social protection of children and social guardianship; b) staff implementing policies and measures in the field of the prevention of discrimination and/or social inclusion in the public and non-public sectors; c) entities implementing measures related to social protection of children and social guardianship; d) entities carrying out activities in public interest. 
The project activities include: a) increasing the effectiveness of work with foreigners who are subject to SPCSG measures (exploring the opinions of children in their mother tongue or in the language reasonably understood by the child given his/her age and mental development, Slovak language training for foreigners); b) staff training in SPCSG facilities and offices of labour, social affairs and family, increasing the effectiveness of socio-psychological care for foreigners; c) ensuring access to international protection, legal counselling and legal assistance to foreigners.

5.1 Economic Migration 
5.1.1 Satisfying Labour Market Needs - Admission Policies and Legislation 
Policies 
At present, Slovakia does not have quotas for labour migration. 
The COLSAF publishes monthly statistics on the situation, development and structure of employment at its website, and carries out analyses and prognoses of labour market developments. 
The influx and outflow of third-country nationals and EU nationals to and from the Slovak labour market are monitored in monthly intervals. 
The impacts of the labour migration of foreign workers on the Slovak labour market are not analysed. 
not require a labour market test by verifying the possibility of filling the vacancy with job applicants recorded by the office of labour, social affairs and family, and job applicants would be only required to prove the education/qualification needed in line with the applicable legislation. 
1. Startup visas for third-country nationals enabling persons with innovative ideas from outside the EU to stay in the Slovak territory during one year on the basis of a national visa. 
106 Authors of startup projects will be able to use all existing services for the implementation of their projects under the condition of establishing a company in Slovakia. 
The proposed measure forms a part of the Concept of Supporting Startups and Startup Ecosystem in the Slovak Republic107 of June 2015 and is envisaged to be fully implemented by the MoE SR by the end of March 2016.108 
The training centres will be established by higher territorial units for strategic sectors (automotive industry and mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, ICT, metallurgy) and prospective sectors (automation, robotics, light metals, chemical industry, creative and energy industries) both of which struggle with the shortage of qualified labour forces. 
The pilot Training Centre for Automotive Industry in Nitra is envisaged to be established in 2016. 
The training centres could also be used for retraining courses for migrants. 
3. Supporting the entrepreneurship of migrants from third countries. 
104 Information provided by the MoLSAF SR. 
106 A third-country national may enter Slovakia on the basis of a national visa which must be requested at the diplomatic mission abroad. 
The applicant for national visa is required to submit together with the application and required documents a statement issued by the respective committee (selection committee) composed of the representatives of state administration (in particular the MoF SR, MoE SR and MoESRS SR) and the private sector confirming that the project was approved by the committee as part of the startup programme. 
The applicant is also required to present a bank account balance statement with a minimum of EUR 8,000 for the purposes of operating in Slovakia. 
In the case of a favourable opinion of the MoI SR, the applicant is issued a national visa in the interest of Slovakia for a period of 12 months. 
The diplomatic mission must decide on the application within ten days. 
The national visa is issued in Slovakia's interest. 
If the third-country entrepreneur plans to stay in Slovakia for more than 12 months, s/he is required to apply for temporary residence for the purpose of business by the last day of the visa validity at the latest. 
Legislation 
The total period of the work permit of a third-country national who was granted the work permit under Article 22(8)110 may not exceed 48 months during the period of five consecutive years. 
The draft amendment is supposed to be submitted to the National Council of the SR by September 2016. 
5.1.2 Efforts to Avoid Social Dumping 
With respect to all categories of migrants listed below, as well as other categories of migrants whose admission is subject to the Act No. 404/2011 Coll. on Residence of Aliens, changes were made in connection with the facilitation of admission of aliens applying for temporary residence on the territory of Slovakia. 
With effect from 20 July 2015, the amendment to the legislation introduced the possibility of extending the period for the submission of the medical opinion confirming that the third-country national does not suffer from a disease threatening public health. 
Highly-qualified workers 
No legislative changes were made in this field compared to 2014. 
Some third countries would enable simplified access of Slovak citizens to their labour market by issuing work visas for a period longer than two years subject to a reciprocal approach by the Slovak Republic on the basis of a bilateral agreement or by guaranteeing reciprocity.

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2015 
the labour market immediately after being settled in Slovakia. 
In the framework of cooperation with third countries in the field of economic migration, the MoLSAF SR prepared together with the MoI SR and the MoFEA SR the Working Holiday Programme in Slovakia for Participants from Australia. 
The programme was approved by the Slovak Government on 26 August 2015113 and was officially signed on 27 May 2015. 
The programme aims to facilitate the necessary procedures for entry and stay of young people aged 18 to 30 years from Slovakia and Australia who intend to spend their holiday in the other country with the possibility to work and study. 
During their stay in Slovakia and Australia, they can enter temporary employment with one employer for a maximum period of six months. 
They can also begin study or vocational preparation for a period of not more than four months. 
The participants can use the programme only once. 
This programme can be used each year by 200 young people from Slovakia and from Australia who will be granted a visa for a period of 12 months, provided that they meet the set conditions. 
The conditions are defined in the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Slovak and Australian Governments in May 2015. 
Slovakia concluded similar working holiday programmes with Canada (2011), New Zealand (2012) and Taiwan (2014).116 117 Other programmes are at the stage of preparations. 
No new developments compared to 2014. 
The deadline for the transposition of the directive by the end of November 2016 is expected to be met. 
At the national level, Slovakia does not have any national scheme in place for intra-corporate transferees. 
The draft amendment will be presented to the Slovak Government by April 2016. 
Entrepreneurs 
Since before arrival of a foreign startup (individual or team) from a third country to the Slovak Republic it is not clear whether the project will be successful in the long term, they would enter the Slovak Republic on the basis of the (D) national visa as per Act No. 404/2011 Coll. on Residence of Aliens and on changes and amendments to some acts, as amended. 
120 Solution V: Granting of national visas to startups from countries from outside the European Union ("startup visas") 
Information on the possibility to obtain national visas and temporary residence for the purpose of business for startups will be published by the MoE SR and the MoI SR on the respective website dedicated to programmes for the support of startups or entrepreneurship, and also through economic diplomats at diplomatic missions. 
Due to this, the issue of the national visa is in Slovakia's interest. 
No new developments compared to 2014. 
Long-term residence 
No new developments occurred in Slovakia concerning long-term residence compared to 2014. 
Equal treatment 
On the proposal of the Department of Gender Equality and Equality of Opportunities of the MoLSAF SR, the approved amendment contains, with respect to gender equality, a negative definition of discrimination in connection with equalizing measures. 
In this regard, the amendment extends the possibility of adopting such measures also on the grounds of sex/gender for all state administration bodies, and also provides such possibility to other legal entities. 
No new policies or measures were adopted in 2015 to facilitate greater mobility of students and researchers. 
The programme is organised by the MoESRS SR in co-operation with the MoFEA SR. 
Starting from the academic year 2014-2015, Slovakia reduced the territorial and sectoral focus for the implementation of this tool. 
The number of partner countries was reduced from 35 to 12, and emphasis is placed on compliance of selected fields of study with the SlovakAid priority sectors for individual partner countries. 
The programme is financed from the budget chapter of the MoESRS SR. 
This change will positively positively influence the possibility to ensure a care for a third-country national even when entrusted into the personal care of a person with recognised status of a third-country national with permanent residence for an indefinite period of time. 
The Visa Information System (VIS) of the Mol SR acquired a new functionality - VISMAIL II. 
Recently, Slovakia has successfully completed an international testing prior to the launch of VISMAIL II, planned on 20 January 2016. 
The number of work places in Russia and Ukraine is expected to increase in 2016 with contractual partners providing outsourcing services related to the collection of visa applications (including fingerprinting).

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2015 
The shifting of these countries to the visa-free list does not automatically mean exemption of their citizens from the visa requirement. 
In all these cases, exemption from the visa requirement is contingent on concluding an agreement between the EU and the particular third country on exemption from the visa requirement. 
Such agreements have so far been signed only with Colombia, the United Arab Emirates, Tongo, Kiribati and Palau; a visa-free regime actually applies only with respect to these countries.

The police department shall also deny departure through the external border to a Union citizen or a family member of a Union citizen if there are reasonable grounds to believe that s/he would join combating or other activities abroad in favour of an organised armed group. 
The air carrier will be obliged to provide information about passengers transported to the Slovak territory through the external border (API data) at request and to the Slovak Intelligence Service. 
5.4.3 Ensuring Slovakia against Fluctuating Migration Pressures 
125 Information provided by the BBAP PFP. 
In 2015, it was necessary to adopt immediate internal measures in connection with the need to address the situation of overfilled police detention facilities for aliens which were not able to receive new persons for capacity reasons. 
It was necessary to seek new solutions for the placement of aliens, mainly with regards to the families with children. 
Since Slovakia has only two such facilities, steps have been made to create a new facility for the placement of aliens. 
In October 2015, concurrence training of the members of the Police Force and Armed Forces of SR was held with the support of the Fire and Rescue Service. 
This training aimed to ensure joint deployment of police and soldiers in mixed guards at designated check-points all along the Slovak-Hungarian border. 
A foreign police unit was set up in November 2015 to protect the EU Schengen border, which can be used not only abroad, but also within Slovakia (see sub-section 7.1.1 in Policies, Training and Cross-Border Cooperation). 
5.5 Integration 
Main programme document in the migrant integration from third coutries was in 2015 Integration Policy of the Slovak Republic,127 128 based on which MOLSAF SR elaborated first cross-ministerial Summary Report on the State of Fulfilment of the Aims and Measures of Integration Policy of the Slovak Republic in 2014.129 
Integration projects implemented in Slovakia in 2015 were mainly financed from the EIF, AMIF fund was approved on 29 July 2015 (see sub-section 5.5.6). 
5.5.1 Socio-Economic Participation 
In the EIF framework, the Slovak Business Agency implemented the project Improving labour market conditions and the entrepreneurship of third-country nationals from March 2014 until the end of June 2015. 
This project dealt with the description and evaluation of the labour market and business conditions of third-country nationals and with a proposal for measures to improve the economic integration of third-country nationals.

05. Legal Migration and Mobility 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2015 
Two focus group debates and a public conference on improving the economic integration of third-country nationals were held as well. 
5.5.2 Promoting Integration of Specific Migrant Groups 
As far as the promotion of integration of UAMs is concerned, the national project Promoting foreigners' integration in SPCSG facilities is planned to be implemented in 2016 from ESF funds through the EU Funds Section. 
130 The project aims to address issues related to the integration of this vulnerable group131 in a comprehensive and systemic manner. 
The project activities aim to improve the effectiveness of work with foreigners subject to SPCSG measures, organise training for staff of SPCSG facilities and labour offices, improve social-psychological care of foreigners, and ensure access to international protection, legal counselling and legal assistance to foreigners. 
Besides standard actors from the state and the non-governmental sector, volunteers from the Who Would Help initiative (see sub-section 5.5) also joined the process of integration of persons under international protection in Slovakia for the first time in 2015. 
In 2015, the SK Government imposed the MoESRS SR to ensure through universities of the third age standardised instruction of Slovak as a foreign language and Slovak realities for asylum seekers and persons under subsidiary protection from 2016. 
The MoESRS SR is due to organise a 10-month course of the Slovak language and vocational preparation for a maximum of 30 Syrian citizens with temporary residence from 01 September 2016.132 
Further to the migration situation, the SK Government decided to set up the first state integration programme for beneficiaries of international protection as an interim scheme until 30 November 2015 and as a systemic solution to the integration of this migrant group until 31 December 2016.133 This state integration programme is expected to become an extended programme of the Integration Policy of the SR mainly in the field of housing, education and access to the labour market. 
130 The intention of the the national project was approved by the commission for Priority Axes 2, 3 and 4 of the Monitoring Committee for the Operational Programme Human Resources in 2015. 
At present, the project is at the stage of preparation of the grant application. 
The national project beneficiary is the COLSAF, and the project partners are the Foster Home Dlaň Medzilaborce, the IOM and legal aid centres. 
134 The Act on Asylum was amended by Act No. 131/2015 Coll. on changing and amending Act No. 480/2002 Coll. and on changes and amendments to some acts, as amended.

seekers are free to access the labour market from one year to nine months without the need to obtain the work permit. 
Once acquiring international protection, third-country nationals are normally free to enter the labour market and are considered disadvantaged job seekers. 
No new developments with regard to third-country nationals. 
5.5.4 Cooperation and activities at local level 
The project financed from EIF funds aims to provide assistance to local authorities and ZMOS members in the management of TCNs integration at the level of local self-governments through the testing of pilot measures in participating towns (Svidník, Snina, Senec, Prievidza, Michalovce, and also Dolný Kubín and Banská Bystrica from December/January 2015) as well as through other supportive activities. 
5.5.5 Involvement of Countries of Origin 
Until the project completion in June 2015, the MoLSAF SR was the expert partner of the IOM national project Headstart: Fostering Integration before Departure which aimed to increase, on the basis of shared information and good practice, the capacities in countries of origin for the provision of relevant and efficient pre-departure integration services to third-country migrants coming to the EU through better networking among European countries and with countries of destination, as well as through better coordination of pre-departure and post-departure integration services.

a) Projects supporting migrant integration 
IOM Migration Information Centre to Support Integration of Migrants in Slovakia (Phase VII) 
The main project objective was to contribute to the effective social, economic and cultural integration of foreigners in Slovakia through counselling, training and information services. 
The project also supported effective cooperation between foreigners' communities and the general population and created space for intercultural dialogue, supported foreigners' community life, improved selected skills of the representatives of foreigners' communities, thus creating the conditions for efficiently addressing issues related to foreigners' integration. 
Since 2006, the IOM Migration Information Centre (MIC), with its offices in Bratislava and Košice, has been the first and so far the only information centre in Slovakia providing TCNs with complex services "under one roof" in the field of legal counselling, labour market inclusion and support of migrants' community life. 
The model of integrated counselling enabled foreigners in Slovakia to deal with their agenda and obtain information under one roof from MIC legal consultants, members of aliens police departments and the staff of labour offices, trade licence offices, citizenship and civil register offices and health insurance companies. 
Legal counselling on residence and citizenship 5 
The project of the Human Rights League aimed to provide complex legal aid and legal representation to third-country nationals and unaccompanied minors, including on-line legal counselling (see sub-section 4.1).141 
Project implemented by the Slovak Catholic Charity with the main objective to support the integration of unaccompanied minor foreigners into society through professional services focused on their psycho-social development and adaptation (see sub-section 4.1).

Project by ZMOS (see sub-section 5.5.4). 
Project by IOM aimed at capacity building of experts providing services to the target group143; active involvement of cultural mediators from different foreigners' communities in the project supported the mutual interaction of the respective groups and ensures the taking into account of foreigners' needs. 
In March 2015, the IOM organised two two-day training sessions for members of alien police departments and the staff of the offices of labour, social affairs and family, district offices, legal aid centres, MoLSAF SR, local councils and offices of self-governing regions. 
The trainings were followed by two workshops in Banská Bystrica and Trnava. 
The workshops formed the second part of the training programme for public administration staff working with foreigners from non-EU countries (see MIC project above).144 
Foreigners continued to be provided with information on the conditions of entry, residence, work, business, studies, etc. by Slovak diplomatic missions abroad.

5.6.2 Awareness Raising on Migration in Slovakia 
151 Since January 2016, the portal is available on the MoLSAF SR website, section on "Information for foreigners', and provides basic information on entry and residence of foreigners in Slovakia, and on housing, employment and education. 
In the framework of the project IOM Migration Information Centre to Support Integration of Migrants in Slovakia (Phase VII) (see sub-section 5.5.6), the centre prepared four regional multicultural and information events on migration and cultural diversity. 
149 Source: http://www.eures.sk/ (consulted on 14/03/2016). 
The strategy imposes several tasks, such as a comprehensive analysis of the state of enforcement and protection of human rights in Slovakia to be performed by the MoEFEA SR by the end of 2016.158 159 On the basis of this strategy, the new Action Plan on Prevention of All Forms of Discrimination 2015-2019 was prepared and approved. 
160 Other important sources to support the Action Plan activities include, in addition to common activities, projects supported under the Operational Programme Human Resources (OP HR)161 and Effective Public Administration (OP EPA).162 
In 2015, the ombudsman164 continued exploring the conditions in police detention cells.

06. Countering Trafficking in Human Beings 
In 2015, Slovakia did not perform special activities or systemic measures to support the development impacts of migration. 
167 Slovakia's activities focused mainly on changing the mechanism of providing official development aid and given the development of forced and irregular migration into the EU humanitarian aid and voluntary contributions to international organisation and EU funds have become one of the key areas of Slovakia's development cooperation. 
Development cooperation and humanitarian aid 
In 2015, Slovakia implemented development cooperation and humanitarian aid in accordance with the Middle-Term Strategy of Development Cooperation of the SR168 2014-2018 and Focus of Bilateral Development Cooperation of the SR in 2015.169 Given the migration situation in Europe, the strategy has not been and will probably not be revised. 
170 The developments in the field of forced and irregular migration into the EU was reflected in the newly prepared draft of the Focus 
168 The strategy identifies eight key programmes of bilateral development cooperation of the SR: Development Interventions Programme, Programme of Handing Over of Transformation Experience, Business Partnerships Programme, Humanitarian Aid Programme, Government Scholarships Programme, Programme of Secondment of Voluntaries and Experts to Developing Countries, Programme of Development Training and Public Awareness in Slovakia, and Capacity Building Programme. 
The strategy defines the following ten territorial priorities for Slovakia: Afghanistan, Kenya, Moldova (programme countries with which Slovakia concluded special development strategies); Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, the Ukraine; and South Sudan (country with extreme humanitarian and development needs). 
This situation also had a secondary impact on the mechanism of providing humanitarian aid, leading to the establishment of a well-working partnership between the government and the non-governmental sector, while highlighting the absence of continuous replenishment of usable material stock. 
Compared to the previous years, in 2015 Slovakia spent several times more resources on development cooperation, humanitarian aid and on supporting solutions to the causes and consequences of the crisis situation in the field of forced and irregular migration: 
1. Under bilateral humanitarian aid (financial and material)176, Slovakia supported the countries affected by the migration crisis with a total amount of EUR 1 201 950 (as of 16/12/2015). 
2. Regarding voluntary contributions to international organisation and EU funds, Slovakia sent: 
• EUR 300,000 to the World Food Programme (WFP); 
• EUR 50,000 to the Funding Facility for Immediate Stabilisation of Iraq (UNDP) 
• EUR 300,000 to the Migrant and Refugee Fund of the Development Bank of the Council of Europe; 
• EUR 50,000 to UNRWA to finance projects for Palestinian refugees; 
• EUR 10,000 to the UNHCR budget; 
• EUR 600,000 to the newly created EU Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa, approved by the SK Government in 2015. 
This contribution will be paid in 2016 and 2017.177 
3. Mandatory contribution to the IOM central budget of CHF 81,845. 
176 Financial humanitarian aid does not include aid to Ukraine which represents a separate budget item in the framework of cooperation with Ukraine.

As a result from the tasks defined in the Government Resolution, the first round of calls for applications for official development aid projects in 2016 will aim at expanding current humanitarian activities of the Slovak organisations, thus contributing to stabilisation of conditions for migrants on the migration routes to the EU and to enhancing living conditions of the refugee communities in the countries of the Near and Middle East neighbouring with Syria. 
The projects should be focused on basic education for children living in the refugee camps in the school year 2016/2017 including necessary infrastructure, on the education of junior and support medical personnel as well as on ensuring of humanitarian aid for the residents returning to their original environment and on migration routes to the EU. 
It will be an accelerated project cycle corresponding to the respective Resolution. 
The drafting of the act was based on the Government Resolution according to which the Slovak Government will seek to increase the effectiveness, flexibility and transparency of providing development aid with the aim to achieve concurrence in the support of Slovakia's economic activities. 
179 The contribution of EUR 3 million ensures Slovakia's membership and voting rights in the MADAD management bodies.

and other entities. 
Moreover, it introduces in the Slovak legislation, along with the granting of subsidies, financial contributions and government scholarships, new development cooperation tools - awarding directly in the partner country, donation of the state's movable property, debt relief in the partner country, granting of soft export loans and other instruments decided by the government. 
184 The new instruments in the field of humanitarian aid include humanitarian subsidies and the awarding of contracts which enable Slovakia to respond more flexibly to the demands of the international community. 
07. Irregular Migration and Smuggling 
Irregular Migration and Smuggling 
Slovakia has long reported low irregular migration rates. 
In terms of statistics, it did not observe sharp increases in irregular migration in 2015: cases of irregular state border crossing were detected to a similar extent as in the previous year (in 222 cases, out of which 92 were Ukraine nationals and 42 were nationals of Afghanistan); on the other hand, the number of detected cases of unauthorised stays in Slovakia was twice as high as in 2014 - an increase from 1,064 to 2,313. 
The most numerous group was formed by nationals of the Ukraine (775, with 619 persons found at the border crossing point upon exit from Slovakia), Syria (576), Afghanistan (223) and Iraq (136). 
Overall, 2,535 cases of irregular migration were detected in 2015, of which 867 cases concerned Ukrainian nationals, 582 Syrian nationals, 265 nationals of Afghanistan and 146 Iraqi nationals. 
185 Statistics on smuggling is provided in Tables 4 and 5 in the Annex and is detailed in sub-section 4.3.1. 
In connection with the situation in the field of migration into the EU, Slovakia did not launch temporary border controls in 2015 and did not report increased pressures on its external border. 
The strategic documents concerning irregular migration in Slovakia is the new National Border Control Management Plan of the SR 2015 - 2018 and the Schengen Action Plan of the SR, which is regularly updated. 
In September 2015, Slovakia implemented temporary measures at the Slovak-Austrian and Slovak-Hungarian border crossing points. 
These measures formed a reaction to temporary implementation of border controls by Germany at its borders with Austria. 
7.1 Enhanced Border Management at the External Borders 
Under Priority 1 of EBF "Supporting further gradual building of the integrated system of external border management with regard to checks of persons and surveillance of the external borders", one project by the BBAP PFP and another one by the Financial Directorate of the SR were implemented: 
The priority of the BBAP PFP project Measures to protect the northern section of the SlovakUkrainian land border by means of a detection and monitoring system was to support further gradual development of the integrated system of external border management with respect to checks of persons and surveillance of the external borders. 
Another objective was to create better conditions to improve the effectiveness of the control and surveillance of the external border of the Schengen Area, including control of irregular migration and other cross-border crimes in the northern section of Slovakia's state border with Ukraine. 
By extending the number of distributed components in the northern section of Slovakia's state border with Ukraine, it is possible to obtain information about cases of unauthorised state border crossing. 
The project was implemented from 10 April 2015 to 30 June 2015.187 
The project by the Financial Directorate of the SR entitled Purchase of special means of transport to improve the effectiveness and quality of control, surveillance and protection of the external border of the Schengen Area aimed to ensure efficient monitoring of the Schengen border with Ukraine to prevent unauthorised border crossing by persons and unauthorised goods transport through the purchase of special means of transport suitable for the protection of difficult terrains along this external border section. 
The project was implemented from 17 April 2014 to 30 June 2015. 
07. Irregular Migration and Smuggling 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2015 
The project was implemented from 01 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. 
Schengen Information System (SIS II) 
The implementation of this project created the conditions for expert training and preparation of the border and alien police staff, using modern didactic technology and innovative methods of teaching. 
The conditions of the training process improved thanks to new equipment for the training room supply of new technologies, such as computer sets, interactive board or multi-purpose laser equipment. 
The secondment of police staff can be carried out on the basis of bilateral agreements with EU Member States on police assistance. 
This measure is based on the urgent need to enhance the personnel capacities of the MoI SR in connection with the current development of migration flows within the European area, fulfilment of Slovakia's international commitments related to the implementation of the migration policy, as well as 
Further to the National Border Control Management Plan of the SR 2015-2018, training within the BBAP PFP runs in the form of training activities and projects based on the applicable Schengen acquis, results of risk analyses, as well as new trends in the forging and alteration of travel documents, countering smuggling and trafficking in human beings. 
The Hungarian side ensured accommodation, catering and fuel193.194 On 06 November 2015, Slovakia also deployed 20 police staff members for one month to guard the Slovenian-Croatian border and keep public order inlands in connection with the migration situation in the country.

7.2 Tackling Misuse of Legal Migration Channels 
7.2.1 Visa Liberalisation 
In 2015, no special measures were introduced to monitor the effects of visa free regimes in Slovakia. 
7.2.2 Family Reunification 
In 2015, no legislative changes or new measures were introduced in this area in Slovakia. 
As for the number of cases of misuse of the family reunification in 2015, the NUCIM BBAP PFP recorded 11 complaints referring to suspicions of misuse of family reunification; charges were brought against 13 persons in 8 cases pursuant to Art. 356 of the Criminal Code201.202 
7.2.3 Study 
No legislative changes occurred in Slovakia in 2015. 
SR continues to record only rare cases of misuse of temporary residence permit for the purpose of study. 
In 2015, 2 claims to initiate prosecution were submitted and related to facilitation of misuse of temporary residence for the purpose of study, 1 case is still being investigated. 
In 1 case charges of migrant smuggling pursuant to Art. 356 of the Criminal Act were brought up against 2 persons. 
SR does not collect statistics regarding misuse of temporary residence permit for the purpose of study. 
Generally, misuse of the permit results in cancellation or non-renewal of the residence which is, however, not recorded as miuse of that instrument. 
7.2.4 Falsified and Forged Travel Documents 
In these cases, 180 documents and 244 border crossing stamps were detected. 
prints in the passports pertained to the person presenting the passport (UKR), but the personal information related to another person (HU). 
The most frequent method of falsification and forging of travel documents along the land border is unauthorised interventions (damage, covering of certain parts, removal of wet stamps). 
There were also cases where Hungarian, Polish and Slovak visas were used to cover the changes in the passports. 
With such visa labels, foreigners covered the stamps of diplomatic missions on denial of visa in order to be issued a new visa by another diplomatic mission. 
Alien police departments most frequently faced falsified medical opinions certifying that aliens do not suffer from a disease threatening public health. 
Such opinions are issued by doctors specialised in infectology. 
In most cases, medical opinions and medical certificates from healthcare facilities in Košice and Martin were falsified. 
In the case of falsified medical opinions, the description part of the opinion was produced by different printing technology (inkjet printing) as was on authentic medical opinions. 
The stamp of authorised person was also produced by coloured ink printing technology, since authentic stamp of authorised person on authentic medical opinion is printed and produced in blue. 
As for forged medical opinions, the documents bore stamp imitations and doctors' signature was scanned and printed by inkjet printer. 
False border crossing stamps are also detected outside Slovakia - at the Consulate General in Uzhgorod. 
In two cases, the wet stamps of diplomatic missions were partially removed and covered with falsified Vietnamese visas. 
7.2.5 Free Movement Rights 
No new developments. 
7.3 The Fight against Facilitation of Irregular Migration (Smuggling) 
7.3.1 Policies, Measures, Activities and Collecting Statistics 
205 Information provided by the BBAP PFP. 
This group focused on close cooperation of its members in combatting irregular migration and smuggling mainly with regard to Schengen border protection, as well as the provision, exchange and sharing of important relevant information which largely influenced the detection and subsequent investigation by NUCIM BBAP PFP staff of nine crimes related to irregular migration and unauthorised state border crossing. 
Slovakia do not face problems related to the collection of statistical data on smuggling. 
According to national statistics, 659 smuggled persons were identified in 2015 (356 in 2014). 
98 persons were apprehended (81 in 2014) and 78 smugglers were sentenced (36 in 2014) (see Tables 4 and 5 in the Annex).207 The increased number of smuggled persons also relates to the implementation of temporary measures at the Slovak-Austrian and Slovak-Hungarian border crossing points in September 2015, which focused, among other things, on the detection of migrant smuggling and responded to the temporary introduction of border controls by Germany on its border with Austria. 
7.3.2 Monitoring and Identifying Migration Routes 
Slovakia has not appointed immigration liaison officers yet, though the National Border Control Management Plan of the SR 2015-2018 counts on their gradual posting. 
Long-term measures include the identification, monitoring and collection of information on irregular migration in Slovakia. 
Slovakia's priority is to ensure appropriate and decent returns irrespective of the type of return (voluntary or forced). 
In line with the Return Directive, voluntary return is the preferred form of return with the possibility of being provided reintegration assistance, which contributes to the sustainability of returns. 
Most returnees left for the Republic of Serbia - Kosovo (55) and Iraq (15).

8.1 Forced Returns and Readmissions 
The project Training of BBAP PFP staff in English and Russian language was organised by Plus Academia n.o. in the reference period. 
The needs of TCNs placed in the PDCAs Medveďov and Sečovce were satisfied in 2015 by the nongovernmental sector via RF projects. 
The project by the civic association Marginal GARANT 2 focused on providing legal assistance, and the project by the Slovak Humanitarian Council entitled Complex coverage of special needs of third-country nationals in PDCAs in Slovakia II sought to provide social and psychological counselling and material assistance and organise spare-time activities. 
8.1.1 EU Readmission Agreements 
Readmission agreements represent an important tool of the EU and its Member States for effective returning to third countries of TCNs residing in the EU without authorisation. 
Readmission agreements also constitute the basis for cooperation between the SR and EU Member States, as well as between the EU and third countries in managing migration and asylum. 
In 2015, Slovakia did not conclude any new bilateral readmission agreement but worked on implementing protocols for the following EU readmission agreements: 
EU Readmission agreement (country) 
Date of agreement (if relevant) 
Agreement between the EC and Bosnia and Herzegovina on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation

08.Returns 
Countries of the Eastern Region 
The NUCIM BBAP PFP fulfils tasks arising from the Plan of Development of Cooperation between the Bureau of the Presidium and the State Border Service of Ukraine. 
During the reference period, 33 mutual operative border meetings of the Operations Department East of NUCIM BBAP PFP and staff of the Chop Operations Department were held in line with the plan. 
The meetings were held on the basis of the current operational situation at the Ubľa - Velykyj Bereznyj border crossing point or at Vyšné Nemecké - Uzhgorod border crossing point. 
On 08 October 2015, an operational meeting was held in Uzghorod between the Director of NUCIM BBAP PFP and with the representatives of the State Border Service Administration of Ukraine in line with the Plan of Development of Cooperation and in connection with the infringement of the SK-UA state border by aircrafts. 
The meeting resulted in the setting up of a working group for exchange of operational information and investigations. 
In 2015, information was exchange between Ukraine and the Slovak Republic also in the form of written queries. 
Given the current security situation in Ukraine, the cooperation of the operational border units is considered satisfactory. 
Western Balkans 
During annual bilateral talks 2014, Slovakia undertook to deploy 14 members of police and pieces of equipment (surveillance aircraft + 5 police crew members) to the joint operations coordinated by Frontex in 2015. 
8.1.3 Enhancing Migration Management and Cooperation on Return Practices 
Since the launch of the SIS II, a photograph is also uploaded for each entry. 
8.2 Voluntary Returns and Reintegrations 
Voluntary returns from Slovakia and subsequent reintegration in third countries are carried out by the IOM in close cooperation with the BBAP PFP. 
Assistance under the AVRR programme has been provided by the IOM in Slovakia since 1998 based on the Agreement on Cooperation between the IOM and the Ministry of Interior of the SR on the assistance with the return of unsuccessful asylum seekers and irregular migrants to the country of origin. 
In the same year, the IOM provided reintegration assistance to 17 individuals of entire families in Georgia, India, Iraq, Kenya, Kosovo, Mexico, Moldova and Vietnam. 
In 2015, the IOM continued in operating the information helpline 0850 211 262 (providing basic information on the return programme and individual consultations to migrants registered in the programme), as well as the website on voluntary returns www.avr.iom.sk, was actively involved in asylum and detention facilities of the MoI SR and across Slovakia according to the demand of the target group, and informed the target group about the possibility to return to the country of origin on a voluntary basis with IOM assistance and obtain reintegration assistance after returning to their country of origin.

8.3 EMN Return Expert Group (REG) 
Slovakia is represented in this group by an expert of the BBAP PFP and an IOM expert. 
Slovakia is usually considered a country of origin and a transit country, as well as a country of destination mainly for nationals of Ukraine and some African countries. 
The information of operational police departments focused on counter-trafficking in human beings suggest that mainly the nationals of Ukraine, Moldova and Vietnam transit through Slovakia to Western European countries. 
However, the detection of such victims is not reported statistically in criminal procedures, and such victims cannot be found not even among victims included in the Programme of Support and Protection of Victims of Trafficking in Human Beings. 
The number of identified foreign victims of human trafficking is low. 
Like in the previous year, only one victim of human trafficking, a third-country national, was identified in 2015 (see Tables 9 and 10 in the Annex). 
The statistics of the Police Force and of the Ministry of Justice suggests that in 2015 prosecution was initiated in 15 cases of human trafficking, charges were brought against 34 persons and 28 persons were sentenced. 
9.1 Legislation, Policies and International Monitoring 
222 Information provided by the OZVEZ KMV. 
09. Counter-Trafficking in Human Beings 
224 There was a retraining provided to those employees who come to the contact with victims as the first ones as well as to experts dealing with the topic of trafficking in human beings. 
In 2015, the Ministry of Justice SR conducted a partial transposition of Directive 2012/29/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2001/220/JHA into Slovak legislation with respect to the part on ensuring the procedural rights of victims under criminal proceedings. 
The Expert Group on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings adopted in November 2015 a new National Referral Mechanism227 which, formalises the system of providing assistance and help to victims of human trafficking. 
According to the National Referral Mechanism, the identified victim is every potential or presumed victim, included in the Program of Support and Protection for Victims of Human Trafficking. 
Mechanism also states that the only the law enforcement bodies in the Slovak Republic are authorised to formally identify a victim of human trafficking. 
On 04 February 2015, the Slovak Government approved the National Programme for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings2015-2018229, which replaces the national programme of 2011-2014. 
The draft of the new national programme does not bring major changes in terms of contents nor budget. 
The document defines the original aims and objectives which should be pursued also in the period 2015 - 2018. 
The document also includes the National Action Plan for Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings. 
The objectives and activities of the action plan focus on four basic areas of countering human trafficking in line with European standards: partnership, prevention, protection of victims, and prosecution. 
The Group of Experts of the Council of Europe on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) published in November 2015 its second evaluation report on the Slovak Republic. 
231 The report mentions the progress achieved in Slovakia during the past four years since the first evaluation report in September 2011 in the framework of implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
GRETA highlighted the new procedures for the identification of victims of human trafficking, which enables them to get access to state financial contributions, and improves collection of data on human trafficking. 
At the same time, the report calls upon Slovakia to better identify and support child victims of human trafficking, in particular on finding a solution to the problem of UAMs disappearing from social care facilities for children and early provision of legal representatives. 
Since no victims of human trafficking were compensated in Slovakia, the report calls upon Slovakia to inform such victims

228 Národný referenčný mechanizmus SR (verzia z novembra 2015) 
In 2015, several activities, events and training sessions were held with a focus on capacity building, development of the national reference mechanism, information exchange and the raising of awareness on trafficking in human beings. 
These activities did not specifically focus on the target group of victims of human trafficking who are TCNs. 
Since some of them have a general nature or can be applied/used with respect to all victims of trafficking irrespective of their nationality, below is an overview of some of them: 
In 2015, Slovakia continued providing the possibility of reporting potential victims of trafficking or the obtaining of preventative information on how not to become the victim of such crime through the free National helpline for victims of human trafficking 0800 800 818. 
Issues related to trafficking in human beings form an integral part of the preparation of consular staff prior to their posting in abroad, and re-training in this field is held in regular half-year intervals. 
In the framework of the pre-departure preparation of consuls, the Information Centre for Combating Human Trafficking and Crime Prevention of the MoI SR together with the IOM and the MoFEA SR in 2015 re-trained 22 consular workers of the MoFEA SR in total. 
9.3 Co-operation at the bilateral and multilateral levels 
At present, no co-operation with third countries in combating trafficking in human beings is developed. 
The Police of the SR collaborates mainly with those countries of destination (United Kingdom, Germany, Austria) in which Slovak citizens become victims of trafficking in human beings. 
The MoI SR perceives the arrangement of effective functioning of the transnational reference mechanism as an important step towards ensuring the protection of the victims of human trafficking. 
The project will be implemented until the end of October 2016.

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
Methodology and Elaboration 
Common specifications for all EU Member States and Norway enable comparability of national reports and their subsequent use for the Europeanwide EMN annual report and other outputs at EU level. 
The report has Part 1, which is prepared for the European Commission and is not publicly available, and Part 2, which as a publication serves the Member States. 
The report includes also national statistics which are not collected at EU level (through Eurostat or Frontex). 
In terms of methodology, the report uses secondary research and has a descriptive nature. 
The report for Slovakia is based on available expert publications, statistics, legislation, Slovakia's policy documents, internet sources and media monitoring1. 
Significant sources of information were reference documents and information obtained from the following state administration bodies: MoI SR (namely BBAP PFP, MO MoI SR, Department of Foreign and European Affairs of the Office of the Minister of Interior, Information Centre for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Crime Prevention of the MoI SR and FAD EPS MoI SR), MoLSAF SR, COLSAF (through MoLSAF SR), MoFEA SR, Ministry of Justice of the SR (through FAD EPS MoI SR) and IOM. 
Materials, publications, and websites of other state, European, international and non-governmental institutions also represent important sources of information. 
Each chapter uses also media releases as sources of information. 
The text therefore contains links to media references to migration topics and activities carried out by public administration, nongovernmental sector and international organisations. 
The expert terms used in this report largely correspond with the definitions in the EMN Migration and Asylum Glossary. 
2 In case the definitions from this Glossary cannot be used for some terms, 
Available at: http://ec.europa.eu/ dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/networks/european_migration_network/glossary/index_a_en.htm (consulted on 24/1/2017). 
the terms are used pursuant to the national or EU legislation (regulations, directives). 
According to the EMN Glossary, an alien (foreigner), in the EU context, is a person who is not a national of an EU Member State, and, in the global context, a person who is not a national of a given State. 
The Slovak legislation, however, defines an alien who is not a national of an EU Member State as third-country national4. 
In this report, the term alien (foreigner) is therefore mainly used in texts and statistics which are related to or are kept in compliance with the national legislation. 
The term migrant is also used in the report, which, unlike the definition in the EMN Glossary5, is used as a synonym of the words alien or third-country national. 
Terms irregular and illegal are considered as synonyms in the report and their use depends on the specific context. 
The Slovak legislation uses the term illegal. 
Terms migration crisis, refugee crisis and migration situation are used in the text as synonyms. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
The report informs about the main changes, developments and activities in the field of migration and international protection in Slovakia in 2016. 
In the Slovak Republic, the report is a unique publication of its kind which annually maps all areas of migration of third-country nationals. 
The report describes changes, developments and activities at the legislative, institutional, political and practical levels from 01 January 2016 till 31 December 2016, and puts them into the context of EU policies and legislation. 
In the annex, the report presents also selected statistics which are not collected at EU level. 
One of the key topics of the political, media and social discussions in Slovakia in 2016 was the migration of third country nationals, particularly the topic of forced and irregular migration into the EU. 
The topic of migration was also an important part of the election campaign and was addressed also by the new Slovak Government of the Slovak Republic in its manifesto for the years 2016-2020. 
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the topic of migration, MoFEA SR established a Task Force for Migration as well as a position of the ambassador-et-large for migration. 
No substantial changes occurred in the Slovakia with respect to the labour market policy in 2016 compared to previous year. 
In the current period of economic growth, however, Slovak employers are beginning to feel a lack of a labour force that will probably intensify during the upcoming decades due to population ageing. 
In 2016, Slovak Republic started preparing amendments of the Act on Employment Services and Act on the Residence of Aliens, transposing among others the directives on seasonal employment and intra-corporate transfer. 
The Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic has desisted from the idea of issuing start-up visa. 
The Government of the SR also approved the Programme of Working Holiday for Japanese Participants in the Territory of the Slovak Republic for young people between 18 and 30 years of age. 
The Integration Policy of the SR was the main programme document on integration of migrants from third countries also in 2016, providing a basis for the MoLSAF SR's second interdepartmental Summary Report on the Fulfilment of Objectives and Measures of the Integration Policy of the SR for 2015. 
Slovakia also approved The Action Plan of the Integration Policy in the MoLSAF SR for 2017-2018 and postponed the date of establishing the state integration programme for beneficiaries of international protection from 31 December 2016 to the end of 2017. 
From the 1 December 2016 there was a change of the implementer of the integration services for beneficiaries of international protection that started to be implemented as a third-year project. 
Strategical documents on irregular migration in Slovakia are the National Border Control Management Plan of the SR for 2015-2018 and the updated Schengen Action Plan of the SR. 
Slovakia did not record any increase in irregular migration in 2016. 
In 2016, Slovakia did not carry out temporary border controls and did not record pressure on its external border. 
There were no major trend changes in returns in 2016. 
As for the forced returns in 2016, 314 persons were forcibly returned from the SR, 1,094 persons (foremost Ukrainian citizens) were returned volunatrily, while 116 of them opted for assisted voluntary return through IOM. 
In 2016, the number of asylum seekers in Slovakia was historically the lowest. 
The amendment to the Administrative Procedure Code led to several changes in the legislation regarding international protection including the introduction of the cassation complaint and the reintroduction of the possibility for asylum seekers to be legally represented by a non-governmental organization. 
A significant result of this recodification of the procedural law is the fact that the decision of the MoI SR on the asylum procedure is considered in force from the moment the Ministry announces it. 
In 2016, Slovakia started with relocations of asylum seekers from other EU MS. By the end of 2016, 9 persons originally from Syria entered the territory of the SR through this mechanism. 
2016 saw no legislative changes affecting the UAMs or other vulnerable migrant groups. 
The number of registered UAMs in Slovakia was low also in 2016. 
The number of identified foreign or third-country victims of human trafficking has been continuously low in Slovakia. 
As for the Slovak victims of human trafficking, while most of them were trafficked for sexual exploitation in the previous years, in the recent period forced labour has come to the fore and forced marriages are a new trend. 
In 2016, the Slovak Republic updated Methodical Tool on the Procedure of the Provision of Assistance to Human Trafficking Victims with a Special Focus on Children and Foreigners. 
In 2016, Slovakia did not perform systemic measures to support the development impacts of migration. 
Compared to previous years, the Slovak Republic was, however, more active in mainstreaming of migration in development policies, following-up on the legislation (new Act on Development Cooperation), documents and activities prepared/initiated in 2015. 
Throughout 2016, humanitarian activities of the Slovak Republic were aimed at assistance to countries and organisations affected by the migration crisis.

The chapter Migration and development provides an overview of the activities and measures for mainstreaming migration into sectoral policies, mitigating brain-drain in the countries of origin, and related to co-operation with third countries in economic migration, work with diasporas and remittances. 
Context for Asylum and Migration Policy Developments 
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the topic of migration, MoFEA SR established a Task Force for Migration as well as a position of the ambassador-et-large for migration. 
2.1 General political and institutional developments 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
of political parties14 addressed the migration topics. 
Robert Kaliňák (SMER-SD) was appointed the Minister of Interior; Ján Richter (SMER-SD) the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family; and Miroslav Lajčák (SMER-SD) the Minister of Foreign and European Affairs. 
As for the European policies, the Manifesto of the Government of the Slovak Republic 2016-2020 states that it is of "key importance to support measures that will contribute to the better management of the external borders of the EU and functioning Schengen Area as a positive achievement of the European integration". 
In 2016, migration and granting international protection became the subject of multiple parliamentary and government negotiations, including the Security Council of the SR. 
The situation was repeatedly commented on by the President of the SR and the Public Defender of Rights. 
Within the inter-ministerial cooperation and coordination in the field of migration, the following bodies continued their activity also in 2016: 
16 A total of 8 political subjects entered the Parliament. 
Besides coalition parties, the following parties were among them: Sloboda a Solidarita, Obyčajní ľudia a nezávislé osobnosti - NOVA, Kotleba - Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko, SME RODINA - Boris Kollár, and Sieť.

If needed, MEKOMIC meetings are attended by inter-governmental and non-governmental organisations. 
above-mentioned concept material for 2016.21 
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the topic of migration, MoFEA SR established a Task Force for Migration that included representatives of the relevant departments of MoFEA SR; it evaluated the current development in the migration agenda on a regular basis. 
29 Similarly, coordination between the internal section of the Permanent Representation of the SR to the EU in Brussels and the Political and Security Committee - (PSC), actively communicating with the target group, took place. 
MoFEA SR established the position of the ambassador-et-large for migration in 2016, to which Igor Slobodník was appointed. 
In the preparatory and implementation stages, the Presidency regularly attended relevant events and actively monitored the situation in European countries. 
Its activities have been performed in close coordination mainly with the Permanent Representation of the SR to the EU and will continue also after the end of the Presidency. 
With effect from 1 November 2016, Jozef Buček31 (the former State Secretary of the Ministry of Interior of the SR) was appointed as the Plenipotentiary of the SR for Tasks Regarding the Implementation of the Schengen Acquis in the SR. 
2.2 Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU 
The historically first Presidency of the SR in the Council of the EU started in the second half of 2016 and in the framework of the rotation system continually followed on the activities of the Dutch Presidency. 
33 34 The Slovak presidency was influenced by the negative result of the UK's referendum to remain in the EU, migration and refugee crisis, terrorist attacks in European cities and continuous consequences of the financial and economic crisis in Europe. 
These activities focus on issues related to the migration of TCNs. 
23 The EMN National Contact Point in the SR comprises the Ministry of Interior, MoLSAF SR, SO SR, and IOM as the coordinator.

02. Context for Asylum and Migration Policy Developments 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
The topic of mixed migration flows and international protection became the priority of the 18-Month Programme of the Council covering the three consecutive upcoming presidencies: Presidency of Netherlands, Slovakia, and Malta37. 
One of the priorities of our Presidency in the Council was sustainable migration and asylum policy, based on the external EU border protection, integrity of the Schengen Area, cooperation with third countries and solidarity. 
SR also considered the effective cooperation in returns and readmissions as crucial. 
The Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU was managed by the MoFEA SR, which established the Secretariat of the Slovak Presidency in the Council of the European Union specifically for this period. 
Significant activities related to the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU in the field of migration included, among others, also these meetings at the ministerial or expert level, organised in Bratislava (in chronological order): 
• On 1 July 2016: Meeting of the CollegeoftheEuropean Commission40, where migration was one of the key topics. 
• On 6 and 7 July 2016: Rethinking Returns from the EU: Sustainable Returns and Cooperation with Countries of Origin42, an European-wide Annual EMN Conference held in Bratislava was organised by the EMN National Contact Point in Slovakia. 
The European Commissioner for Migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, Home Affairs and Citizenship, IOM director general, William L. Swing and the Minister of Interior of the SR, Robert Kaliňák spoke at the conference that had been in preparation since 2015 and focused on the returns in the context of cooperation with the third countries. 
• On 7 - 8 July 2016: Informal Justice and Home Affairs (JHA)46 Council in Slovakia during which

Besides that, these three presidencies will work on the improvement of the connection between migration, security, and external policy. 
Three presidencies aim at reaching progress in the currently running legislative activities regarding the new management of the external borders and Visa Code. 
Another important aspect influencing the Slovak Presidency will be the approval and implementation of the proposals regarding the European Border and Coast Guard.

Debates covered also global dimension of migration also in the context of (then) upcoming migration summits in New York, September 2016. 
Minister of Interior of the SR hightlighted the need of so called flexible solidarity among the EU Member States which would take into account the capacities of each state (during SK PRES this concept was gradually developed and introduced in the form of effective solidarity on December summit of the European Council). 
Ministers also dealt with the CEAS reform. 
• On 14 - 15 July 2016: Informal Meeting of Ministers for Employment and Social Policy (EPSCO)48 was organised also briefly touched upon the migration issue (migration of the highly-qualified workers, demographic changes, migration and digitalisation).49 
• On 18 - 19 July 2016: Informal meeting ofthe Strategic Committee for Immigration, Frontiers and Asylum (SCIFA).50

The Slovak Presidency hosted abroad: 
•On 5 December 2016: Ministerial Meeting EU-USA in Washington, dealing with the fight against terrorism, foreign fighters of Daesh, cybercrime, human trafficking as well as the new European system in making ETIAS (Europan Travel Information and Authorisation System), to be launched in Europe. 
This meeting was preceded by the meeting of EU and US high officials aimed at cooperation in the field of justice and interior and main challenges EU and US are presently facing. 
This meeting was held on 8 - 9 September 2016 in Bratislava.

On 24 October 2016, European Commission (Eurostat) has organised a Round Table on Migration in Bratislava attended by officials and representatives of Eurostat and Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic. 
Discussions resulted into choosing topics for further detailed research, including e.g. the following elements of methodology: what is to be measured in migration, the concept and terminology of migration, alternative sources of data, metadata, timeliness of statistics, cooperation among the national statistical institutions, processors of the administrative data sources and researchers, migration patterns, length of stay and migration cycles, migration routes analysis, migrants' characteristics, data mapping on national level, migrants'skills and remittances sent to sending countries. 
The topics were divided among the experts depending on the research tasks. 
Results of this project will be presented on the 2017 conference in Brussels59.60 
2.3 Migration in media 
Media continued to be highly interested in migration and international protection topics. 
61 62 Media covered foremost the continuing intense migration of asylum-seekers into the EU, EU measures in this regard, situation in the Mediterranean sea, Syria and affected countries of the Middle East, as well as Greece, Italy, and Balkan transit countries. 
63 These topics and proposals for solutions in this field were also the topic of the pre-election discussions of the political parties before the parliamentary elections which took place in March 2016.

3.1 Economic migration 
3.1.1 Main developments 
No substantial changes occurred with respect to the labour market policy in 2016. 
Slovakia has no quotas or lists of scarce jobs in place regarding labour migration. 
Labour migration focuses on compensation of the lack of a disposable labour force in the labour market or job positions unattractive for the domestic labour force. 
64 Information provided by the MoLSAF SR. 
On 21 April 2016, the Representation of the European Commission in the SR and Institute for Economic and Social Reforms (INEKO) organised a seminar in order to discuss migration in the context of labour market needs in the SR. 
65 According to the seminar outputs in the current period of economic growth, Slovak employers are beginning to feel a lack of a labour force that will probably intensify during the upcoming decades due to population ageing66.67 
It is expected that the amendment to the Act on Residence of Aliens will be approved by the National Council of the SR until 15 May 2017. 
Presidency of the SR in the Council of the EU 
Priorities of the Slovak Presidency in the field of legal migration included negotiations on the recall of the EU Blue Card Directive. 
In September, the Presidency finished the first reading of the proposal and from October 2016, submitted compromise proposals at the meetings of the Working Party on Integration, Migration and Expulsion; it also examined the provisions regarding qualifications recognition, double status of beneficiaries of international protection, and provisions on relatives of EU citizens. 
Different possibilities regarding the salary threshold were discussed in depth and the MS had the opportunity to present their national schemes for accepting highly-qualified workers from third countries. 
3.1.2 Facilitating admission of migrants into Slovakia 
In 2016, the Slovak Republic granted 10,304 first residence permits for family reasons, for the purpose of education and study, as well as remunerated and other activities (see the Table 1 in Annex). 
Administrative fees for residence permit applications has not changed compared to 2015 (see the Table 2 in Annex). 
Highly qualified workers

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
4.1 Statistics and trends 
The number of asylum applications in Slovakia has been low in the long-term. 
Since entry of the SR into Schengen Area at the end of 2007, the number of asylum applications did not exceed the number one thousand while the decreasing trend continues104. 
104 In 2007, a total of 2,642 asylum applications was submitted, in 2008 the number decreased to 909 applications, in 2012 the SR recorded 732 asylum applications, in 2013 a total of 441 applications was submitted, in 2014 a total of 331 and 330 applications in 2015. 
•ft

4.2 Common European Asylum System (CEAS) and legislative changes 
Legislative changes 
According to the new concept of the Administrative Procedure Code, administrative courts will no longer decide on the remedy against the invalid decisions of public administration authorities. 
A significant result of the recodification of the procedural law is the fact that the decision of the Ministry of Interior of the SR on the asylum procedure is considered in force from the moment the Ministry announces it. 
Further legislative changes resulting from the adoption of the new Administrative Procedure Code include e.g.: 
• Prosecutor's competencies (Article 45 and following), which include the authorisation to submit an administrative appeal or cassation complaint regarding asylum, if they filed an appeal that was turned down. 
• Asylum seekers can be legally represented by non-governmental organisations that provide assistance to foreigners; in this case an authorized employee or a member of such an organisation with a second law degree can act on its behalf.

108 Changes of the Administrative Procedure Code have had an impact on the detention procedure and the administrative expulsion procedure. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
• Regarding the review of the decisions carried out by administrative courts, new institutes were introduced such as specialized type of administrative appeal regarding asylum and cassation complaint. 
Filing an administrative appeal is accompanied by the possibility of requesting a suspensive effect in the case of decisions that do not automatically include a suspensive effect. 
A cassation complaint can be filed against a valid decision of a Regional Court; however, no new facts and evidence can be provided except for facts and evidence confirming the validity and timeliness of the cassation complaint.

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies - Slovak Republic 2016 
Cooperation with third countries 
The mission was organized within the cooperation of the V4 countries. 
In April 2016, the European Commission issued a communication titled "Towards a Reform of the Common European Asylum System and Enhancing Legal Avenues to Europe"115, which proposed systemic changes necessary to create a humane, just, and effective Common European Asylum System (CEAS) also during the period of a high migration pressure. 
The communication also proposed a set of measures to improve the management of legal migration. 
Based on these concept materials, two packages of legislative proposals were prepared. 
The first package included regulation proposals regarding Dublin, EURODAC, and the idea of the EU Agency for Asylum. 
The second package also presented a proposal regarding the resettlement scheme with the aim of creating a resettlement framework together with the introduction of unified resettlement procedures. 
The proposals were discussed at the meetings of the Asylum Working Party (AWP). 
During the Slovak Presidency, AWP focused specifically on these proposals. 
The Presidency opted for the 3-track approach and primarily focused on the proposals that allowed for a constructive discussion leading to a significant progress. 
This way a partial general consensus regarding the EURODAC Regulation and the EU Agency for Asylum was reached. 
Further negotiations regarding the two proposals are about to start, however, they will be led by the Maltese Presidency. 
Other proposals were also simultaneously elaborated. 
4.2.1 National and European Jurisprudence 
There were no significant decisions taken in national jurisprudence regarding asylum that would have an impact on relevant policies in 2016. 
As for the decisions issued by the Court of Justice of the EU, the MoI SR takes into consideration the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU in the application practice; however, no specialized policies were adopted. 
4.2.2 Efficiency and Quality of asylum system 
The MO MoI SR implemented no significant changes influencing the effectiveness or quality of the asylum system in 2016. 
Similarly to the previous years, in 2016 MO MoI SR acted in compliance with the Further Developing Asylum Quality (FDQ) system that had been developed in cooperation with UNHCR116. 
115 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Towards a reform of the common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe [COM(2016) 197 final]. 
116 In the initial stage, the system focused on improving the quality of the asylum decision-making process and introducing an evaluation mechanism. 
In the second stage, the preparation of decision-makers was monitored as well as the interviews and written decisions on the applications for international protection. 
Except for judicial review, the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the SR recorded no criticism regarding the national asylum system that would require taking any measures in 2016. 
4.3 Cooperation with the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) 
The SR does not received any assistance from EASO in 2016. 
Asylum Support Teams 
Despite limited human resources (partly due to the SK PRES), the employees of the MO MoI SR actively participated in multiple activities under the auspices of EASO in the second half of 2016. 
On one hand, Slovakia has the opportunity to express its solidarity; on the other hand, it is gaining new and valuable experience. 
Specifically, the activities included the following:

4.4.2 Relocations 
Based on the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and of Greece125 (so called the First Relocation Decision), the SR voluntarily undertook to admit 100 persons. 
In accordance with the Decision, in May 2016 the SR submitted a pledge for the relocation of the first 10 persons from Greece, opting to focus on vulnerable groups, mainly single women with children. 
The SR accepted the responsibility upon the condition that these persons are holders of valid documents since it is impossible to verify the identity of persons without valid travel documents. 
In August 2016, the first three persons were admitted from Greece and granted asylum on humanitarian grounds. 
Subsequently, the SR submitted 2 more relocation pledges based on which it admitted 6 more persons from Greece. 
They were also granted asylum on humanitarian grounds (see Table 7 in

No other bilaterally planned relocations were carried out. 
4.5 Enhancing external dimension including resettlement 
4.5.1 Resettlement 
Slovakia continued humanitarian transfers through the Emergency Transit Centre (ETC) in Humenné carried out in cooperation with the UNHCR and IOM since 2009 (see Table 8 in Annex).127 In 2016, 156 refugees were transferred into the ETC in Humenné; 196 refugees who came to the Centre in 2015 and 2016 were resettled to the USA. 
These were mostly families with small children forced to leave their homes due to persistent conflicts and unrests, and whose return was not possible. 
In 2016, 149 Iraqi nationals admitted by the SR within the humanitarian admission in December 2015 were being integrated. 
4.5.2 Enhancing the capacity of third countries of first asylum

2016 saw no legislative changes affecting the UAMs or other vulnerable migrant groups. 
COLSAF, however, has prepared several application and methodical guidelines directing the activities of the socio-legal protection of children and social guardianship bodies in provision of care for the UAMs. 
5.1 Unaccompanied minors 
Statistics and trends 
Slovakia has not recorded a significant increase in the number of UAMs in 2016 (see Table 9 in Annex). 
In cases of unauthorised border crossing and unauthorised stay a total of 23 UAMs were intercepted in 2016, out of which half of them was of Afghan nationality. 
131 In this year, SPCSG bodies recorded a total of 36 UAMs, most of them males, and out of them 33 UAMs were placed in the foster home for UAMs Dlaň in Medzilaborce. 
131 Source: Statistical Overview of Regular and Irregular Migration in the Slovak Republic in 2016 (2017). 
BBAP PFP, Bratislava. 
132 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
In 2016, two UAMs seeked asylum compared to 3 cases in 2015, 11 cases in 2014133 a 5 cases in 2013134. 
As for the UAMs not seeking asylum, there was an decrease from 68 UAMs in 2013135 to 10 in 2014136, 23 in 2015 and 31 in 2016 (see Table 9 in Annex). 
One UAM was granted asylum, the child is being taken care of by a professional family. 
In 2016 foster care home in Medzilaborce provided mainly care for UAMs from Afghanistan (14 UAMs), Romania (4 UAMs), Nepal (3 UAMs) a Syria (3 UAMs). 
As of 10 January 2017, 7 UAMs were placed in the foster care home Dlaň Medzilaborce, out of them one being a female. 
Disappearance remains a persistent problem in provision of care for UAMs. 
In 2016, a total of 19 UAMs left the facility for the enforcement of a court decision (i. 
e. the foster home for UAMs) without permission. 
Due to this a research task Identifying the Causes of Unaccompanied Minors Go Missing is being carried out within the contract between the MoLSAF SR and the Institute for Labour and Family Research, with the aim to analyse the causes of UAMs' escapes, propose and and adopt measures for their elimination and prevention. 
Policies, legislation and measures 
Slovakia has not adopted any new legislation on receiving the UAMs or providing care for them in 2016. 
The currently prepared amendment to the Act on Residence of Aliens139 proposes that a TCN stating to be an UAM is obliged to undergo a medical screening in order to determine his/ her age in case the TCN is suspected to be an adult. 
Under the current legislation, only a person who is clearly a minor is not obliged to undergo the screening. 
Apart from regular working meetings and methodical days, the COLSAF also uses the methodical and application guidelines to improve the quality of SPCSG measures' implementation. 
The directive defines closer details on the processes of OLSAFs during the implementation of SPCSG measures for UAMs present in the territory of the SR. 
141 The directive unified the process of SPCSG bodies in the particular phases of providing care for the UAMs in line with the amended legislation, implementation of international agreements in this field as well as needs stemming from the practice. 
As a followup on this directive, COLSAF prepared the "Application Guidelines on the Application of the Best Interests of the Child Principle in all Processes, Measures and Decisions Adopted in Relation to Unaccompanied Minors"in December 2015. 
The Guidelines are intended mainly for SPCSG bodies, foster homes and other bodies providing the UAMs with assistance.

Projects 
The currently prepared national project Promoting Foreigners' Integration in the Facilities for the Socio-legal Protection of Children and Social Guardianship146 will focus on finding a systematic solution to the comprehensive support for the integration of foreigners placed in the SPCSG facilities. 
The objective is to promote the smooth integration of foreigners who came to the SR as minors. 
The national project should, via quantitative and qualitative improvements in working with a child, promote the comprehensive care of the UAM, who is applying for asylum as well as prevent the socio-pathological phenomena causing social exclusion. 
COLSAF has prepared the Promoting Foreigners' Integration in SPCSG Facilities national project with implementation planned for 2017-2019, in order to promote the increased participation of disadvantaged and vulnerable persons in society, including the labour market. 
Among the activities of the national project there are mainly the provision of interpreting services, legal counselling and assistance, personnel, material and technical equipment for psychological, educational and social care for UAMs as well as activities focusing on extending the teaching of Slovak, obtaining or achieving adequate education, success in the labour market, housing and other conditions necessary for the independence of young adults. 
143 This norm sets out procedures of SPCSG body in identification of indicators of trafficking in human beings, cooperation with Police Force bodies and MoI's contracting organisations in providing assistance to humantrafficking victims, conditions for their placement to the Programme of Support and Protection for Human Trafficking Victims and other aspects of implementing of SPCSG measures for the victims, especially also in relation to UAMs who belong to vulnerable groups facing higher risk of trafficking in human beings.

6.2 Integration projects 
Slovak 2016 integration projects were funded by the AMIF fund approved on 29 July 2015. 
A national project relating to migration and integration of third-country nationals was, for the first time, supported by the EU Funds Section of the ESF: the Promoting Foreigners' Integration in SPCSG Facilities project (see Sub-chapter 5.1 Projects). 
The following projects were implemented within the AMIF fund in 2016: 
The project also supported cooperation between foreigners' communities and the major population; it created space for an intercultural dialogue and also supported foreigners' community life. 
160 In 2016, the MIC offices in Bratislava and Košice provided 2,785 individual clients with 4,374 personal, phone or e-mail consultations concerning main areas of living in Slovakia such as residence, family, employment, entrepreneurship, education, or citizenship. 
It counselled a further 97 clients in cooperation with the representatives of foreigners' communities during field work. 
MIC clients came mainly from the Ukraine, Russian Federation, Serbia, India, USA and Iran. 
43,126 people searched for information for foreigners on living in Slovakia on MIC website www.mic.iom.sk in 2016.161 The new project will recommence in January 2017 and last 3 years.

The participants of the programme learnt basic information on living in Slovakia, cultural facts, and value system. 
Access to social security, healthcare and housing 
The SR did not implement any new policies or measures in this field in 2016. 
Integration into the labour market 
Following the proposed amendment to the Act on Employment Services from 2016, the access of several TCN categories to the SR labour market is facilitated. 
The proposal contains, among other things, an extension of TCN groups, who are not required to submit in order to work, the confirmation of the possibility to fill a vacancy corresponding to highly-qualified employment, the confirmation of the possibility to fill a vacancy, or a work permit. 
A third-country national granted asylum or subsidiary protection under the provisions of the Act on Employment Services is considered a disadvantaged job seeker. 
Such a seeker, in relation to their access to the labour market, is not required to submit a work permit, the confirmation of the possibility to fill a vacancy corresponding to highly-qualified employment, or the confirmation of the possibility to fill a vacancy. 
Such a seeker also has access to the employment services tools of active labour market policy under the same conditions as Slovak citizens.

A legislative change to the Act on Employment Services was in preparation since 2016, will provide a TCN granted a status of a third-country national who is long-term resident in the EU in Slovakia a legal status that is equal to the status of a Slovak citizen, in all legal relations under the Act on Employment Services. 
Apart from standard government and non-governmental players, the volunteers from the Who Would Help167 initiative took part in the integration of beneficiaries of international protection in Slovakia in 2016.

The website on (non-)discrimination offers information to both the professional public and entities obliged to non-discriminate alongside basic counselling to persons endangered by discrimination. 
It also includes a separate chapter on information about the implementation of the horizontal non-discrimination principle in programmes and projects supported by structural funds in the 2014 - 2020 programming period. 
The expert public will find information on the theoretical foundations of equal treatment and prohibition of discrimination, such as types of discrimination, protected characteristics, and the areas where the prohibition of discrimination applies. 
The site also includes the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, European Court of Human Rights, and national courts, which are relevant to the interpretation of the anti-discrimination law. 
In the first quarter of 2017, MoLSAF SR will, via the Implementation Agency as an intermediary under the Operational Programme Human Resources governing authority, launch a call for proposals "Counselling and Education on the Prevention and Elimination of Discrimination".169 
6.6 Integration at local level 
Council of the Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia (ZMOS) adopted in April 2016 a document Possibilities of cooperation between Migration Office of the MoI SR and ZMOS in integration of beneficiaries of international protection which suggests to create a consultation platform on integration policy issues (consisting of representatives of expert sections, pilot towns involved in project BUK and self governing bodies in case they express their interest to participate in such activity, as well as of representatives of NGOs with experience in this field) and communication networks involving specific individuals at ministries and state offices/organisations. 
On 23 August 2016, the Human Rights League organised the Forum on Refugee Integration and Resettlement in Central and Eastern Europe. 
171 Both domestic and foreign experience regarding the involvement of local authorities in the integration of migrants and refugees, capacity-building of the authorities as well as the best practices and challenges of integration on the local level were presented during the forum. 
On 25 November 2016, an EMN meeting entitled Cooperation of Local/Regional Authorities and Other Actors in the Field of Integration of Refugees in Bratislava and Košice was held in order to discuss and strengthen the cooperation of representatives from state administration, local authorities, educational institutions, non-governmental organisations, and private sector in the integration of beneficiaries of international protection, and involvement of individual participants in the process. 
Besides this, the meeting focused on the identification of problematic areas, pos-

sible solutions, and effective ways of interconnecting the beneficiaries of international protection with the invited stakeholders. 
The deadline was postponed to 31 December 2017. 
The preparation of the programme will require cooperation and the active involvement of local governments. 
The Centre for the Research of Ethnicity and Culture (CVEK) and Slovak representation of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation organised a three-day information trip to Bavaria, Germany for 5 Slovak local politicians. 
They met dozens of people either directly working with refugees or being responsible for related processes at the local level. 
They explained how local administration faced the pressure created by large numbers of incoming refugees. 
6.7 Awareness-raising on migration 
The Action Plan describes the measures related to broadening the host country awareness on migration: the measures will be continuously fulfilled by the responsible entities. 
In 2016, the MoLSAF SR in cooperation with Human Rights League, IOM and the Press Council of the SR prepared the proposal of the Ethical Rules of Presenting Information on the Topics of Migration and Integration. 
After the approval of the final version of this document, the MoLSAF SR will arrange its release, dissemination and promotion.

It was created within the project Integration Forum - Platform for an Open Dialogue about the Migration and Integration of Foreigners. 
The MoLSAF SR will continue seeking further possibilities of cooperation in order to implement and later disseminate the strategy. 
6.8 Involvement of countries of origin 
Given the need for the effective integration of TCNs as well as reflecting the Action Plan on the Integration of Third-Country Nationals published by the Commission in 2016180, the Slovak Presidency has prepared a draft proposal of the Council and of the Member States Governments' representatives' Conclusions on the integration of third-country nationals with legal residence in the EU. 
The conclusions were approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 December 2016.181 While preparing the conclusions, consultations took place in several Council work groups (employment, education, sports, youth and culture) and showed that this is a priority and crosssectional topic.

7.2 Forced returns 
The Slovak Republic has been inserting data on all denied entries (at the national level) to persons with identity confirmed based on a document issued by their home country into the SIS since 2007. 
Since the SIS II has been launched, each entry is to be accompanied by a photograph; from 1 July 2016, the SR sends in a photograph of each person regardless of whether their identity has been confirmed based on a document or not. 
The SIS II entry includes information on the type of identity (confirmed, unconfirmed, alias).183 
Within the AMIF projects in line with the National AMIF Programme in 2016 the following activities facilitating quick, sustainable, and effective return were performed184: 
• BBAP PFP project "Forced Return - AMIF I" which followed up previous national projects was aimed at improving effectiveness of return operations management and ensuring sustainable, safe and dignified return of TCNs. 
In this project activities to successful management and carrying out of return operations were implemented, including arrangement of transfer, travel and flight tickets, accommodation, and assistance to target group and enhancement of information provision, interpreting and expert age screening, arrangement of emergency travel documents for TCNs in the process of forced return. 
All these activities and their mutual interconnection in this project create the basis of successful returns from the territory of the SR as well as inevitable part of return policy of the SR. 
From the SR a total of 314 forced returns and 1,094 voluntary returns was carried out in 2016, most of them concerning Ukrainian nationals (see Table 6 in Annex). 
• The main goal of the Slovak Humanitarian Council's project "KOMPAS" was to ensure efficient return process during which a specific assistance was provided to TCNs in detention. 
Clients were provided with complex services and the same conditions were set up in the PDCAs in Medveďov and Sečovce. 
The needs of TCNs placed in PDCAs were addressed by providing basic, supplementary and supporting services for persons placed in these facilities. 
The project activities were aimed at all persons placed in PDCAs, however, with special focus on vulnerable groups who were provided with special attention and approach. 
• The BBAP PFP project "Capacity Building in the field of Returns" was aimed at creating more efficient return process in order to reach smooth return, this via capacity building of employees directly involved in return policy, in the form of trainings for policemen carrying out returns as well as for representatives of selected DMs of the SR abroad. 
These trainings focused on the following topics: return-related legislation, especially issuance of decisions on administrative expulsion, implementation of such decisions, detention of foreigners in PDCAs, alternatives to detention, prevention of irregular migration of TCNs etc. Implementation of the project contributed to increased qualification of the employees involved in the return process and hence to more successful return operations and efficient return policy management. 
• Since the "KOMPAS" project was finished on 30 November 2011, a follow-up three-year project "KOMPAS II" will be implemented by the Slovak Humanitarian Council from 1 December 2016.

Irregular Migration Including Smuggling 
In total, there were 2170 irregular migration cases out of which more than half concerned citizens of Ukraine and to a lesser extent citizens of Iraq, Serbia and Afghanistan. 
8.1 Statistics and trends 
The SR has recorded low scale of irregular migration in the long-term. 
In 2016, the SR also did not record any increase in irregular migration: unauthorised border crossing was detected at similar levels as in previous year (in 208 cases, out of which 92 were related to Ukranian nationals, and 42 nationals of Aghanistan), unauthorised stay in the territory of the SR occurred in 1,962 cases. 
A total of 1,234 cases was related to Ukranian nationals (while 863 persons were detected at the border crossing point when leaving the SR), 145 cases were nationals of Iraq, 123 cases were Serbian nationals and 114 cases were nationals of Afghanistan. 
188 Statistics on smuggling are listed in Table 4 and 5 in Annex and in more detail described in sub-chapter 8.4.1. 
Technology, equipment and infrastructure 
The BBAP PFP gradually changed or added camera systems on 5 border crossing points of the external border in 2016 - within the "Improvement of Technical and Educational Capacities to Accelerate the Handling Process of the Joint Slovakia-Ukraine Border" project financed by the Norwegian Financial Mechanism and the state budget of the SR. 
The objective of supplementing and renewing the camera system is to assess the waiting periods on border crossings more efficiently and subsequently allow the supervising authorities to adopt inapt coercive measures. 
Other objectives include lowering the potential for corruption, increasing the safety of citizens, members of the Customs Administration and the PF personnel, and contributing to the improvement in communication and attitude of public agents to citizens during the handling process at the border crossing points. 
The department of the Border Police of the BBAP PFP was one of the possible implementers of the projects within the National Programme ISF - Internal Security Fund under the specific objective 2 Borders190 in 2016. 
Testing the operations of special systems and equipment on the Slovak-Ukraine state border were executed. 
Background documents on the preparation of direct calls for grant applications were prepared based on the results of the testing operations. 
The implementation of the projects is planned to start in January 2017.191 
Other activities 
Following the continual education of members of the Border and Aliens Police and aimed at ensuring the required level of knowledge and practical experience of BBAP PFP departments, an annual BBAP PFP director's order is prepared in order to implement the continual education

of the Border and Aliens Police members. 
A total of 95 Slovak police officers tasked with border control and 65 members of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine were trained. 
Slovakia actively participated in Frontex educational activities in order to increase the interconnection and effectiveness of cooperation in border protection and improve the efficiency of the Slovak Republic's external borders. 
They included specialized trainings and workshops aimed at preparating for operational activities, the detection of false travel documents, human trafficking, respect for human rights, and training for border surveillance (land and air border). 
Some were intended for screeners, debriefers and personnel providing second line airport checks as well as for escorts during joint return operations, and Schengen evaluators. 
Apart from those, Slovak experts actively participated in the organization of Frontex educational activities - either as assistants or trainers for Common Core Curriculum (CCC), the detection of false documents, and language classes. 
Slovakia is represented in the annual Joint European Cross Border Cooperation study modules jointly organized by Frontex, the University of Malta and other partner academic institutions within the European Cross-Border Cooperation. 
The SR received police officers from Estonia, Poland, the Netherlands and Switzerland in the BCD PF contact point in Vyšné Nemecké within the 2016 Focal Point Land joint operations. 
With regard to the Foreign Unit of the Police Force activities, deployed police officers undergo a basic pre-departure training at every rotation.

Given the low number of submitted asylum applications in 2016, it can be concluded that the visa liberalisation did not impact the number of unfounded applications. 
No special regime for monitoring the visa-free regime influence was introduced. 
It is expected that a joint ETIAS system for the registration of people travelling from visa-free countries, the adoption of which was supported by the SR, will be introduced.

8.3.2 False or forged travel documents 
Compared to the previous year, the number is still substantial. 
166 persons provided false documents in 2016. 
Compared to 2015, this means a decrease by 69 persons. 
136 false or altered documents (passports, ID cards, residence permits, visas, supporting documents) and 192 false, altered or illegally obtained border crossing stamps were identified in these cases. 
An overall year-on-year decrease of 24.5% in documents and of 21.3% in border crossing stamps was identified. 
Ukrainian nationals were identified as the most frequent users of false documents, amounting to 71.7% of all identified cases. 
They were followed by the nationals of Syria and the same number of cases (3) was recorded for the nationals of Iran, Nigeria, Turkey and Moldova. 
With respect to the place of identification, 105 persons were identified at the land border (51 at the entry point and 53 at the exit point), 40 persons inland and 21 persons at the airports. 
False border crossing stamps in passports represent the most frequently identified phenomenon during attempts to enter or exit the SR via a land border crossing. 
Unauthorized interventions (damage, covering of certain parts, removal of wet stamps) remain the second most frequent way of forging or altering travel documents at land border. 
Ukrainian nationals presented impostor ID cards at the international airports' border control in Bratislava, Košice, and Poprad. 
False criminal record statements of Syrian nationals with an altered issue date without an official record of the change were most frequently presented at the Aliens Police Departments together with the applications for the granting, renewal, or extension of residence permits. 
The applications were rejected, as the records showed signs of alteration. 
Syrian nationals, via legal representatives, appealed the procedure. 
False border crossing stamps were also detected outside the SR - at the Slovak General Consulate in Uzhhorod. 
A decrease in the number of cases of both identified irregular border crossing stamps and altered passports was recorded. 
The passport alteration modus operandi was the same as the one used at the land border. 
BBAP PFP has adopted measures to increase the effectiveness of prevention and improve the proficiency in the identification of false and altered documents. 
These measures mainly concern monthly meetings to inform the members of the Border and Aliens Police on individual forms and methods of forging and altering documents. 
Another measure is the use of operational information (ad-hoc information) on identified cases of the forging and altering of documents. 
202 Information provided by BBAP PFP. 
203 Information provided by BBAP PFP. 
Depending on the availability of statistical data on identified cases of forging, alteration, and misuse of documents, statistics of legal and irregular migration in the territory of the SR, which are regularly updated and accessible on the BBAP PFP intranet (monthly, quarterly, bi-annually, annually) can be used by the Border and Alien Police. 
8.3.3 Free movement right 
No new activities to monitor and analyse information on the fraud and misuse of free movement were implemented in 2016. 
8.4 Prevention of unsafe migration and the fight against facilitation of irregular migration ('smuggling') 
8.4.1 Policies, measures, activities and collection of statistics 
The cooperation resulted in charging 19 offenders with the crime of smuggling. 
Such cooperation based on joint investigation teams can thus be evaluated as very effective and swift. 
NUCIM BBAP PF has not recorded any issues in monitoring and collecting statistical data on migrant smuggling. 
In 2016, the SR identified 1,181 smuggled persons, indicted charges for crime of migrant smuggling against 104 persons and convicted 88 persons (see the Table 4 and 5 in Annex).

Countering Trafficking in Human Beings 
Similar to previous year 2015, one victim of human trafficking from a third country was identified in 2016. 
9.1 Legislation, policies and international monitoring 
In 2016, MoI SR has prepared, in cooperation with MoLSAF SR, MoFEA SR and the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic, an updated Methodical Tool on the Procedure of the Provision of Assistance to Human Trafficking Victims with a Special Focus on Children and Foreigners214 which fully replaces the previous methodical tool215 from 2012. 
214 The guideline was published on the MoI SR intranet in the section Methodical Guidelines. 
The SR is considered a country of origin and transit with regard to victims of human trafficking. 
Destination country is foremost for citizens of Ukraine and several African countries. 
The intelligence of operative police units tasked with counter-trafficking suggest that through the SR citizens of Ukraine, Moldova and Vietnam are transferred to Western Europe. 
The interception of such persons, however, is not statistically recorded within criminal proceedings and at the same time they are not listed as victims into the Programme of Support and Protection for Human Trafficking Victims. 
In 2016, a total of 45 human trafficking victims were identified in the Slovak Republic and 21 of them have agreed to enter the Programme of Support and Protection for Human Trafficking Victims. 
A change in the exploitation of victims undoubtedly belongs to the newest trends in human trafficking on both the national and European levels. 
While most victims of human trafficking were subject to sexual exploitation in the previous years, in the recent period forced labour has come to the fore. 
Human trafficking in the form of forced marriages is a completely new trend. 
The Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Latvia is the principal applicant and other partners, apart from MoI SR, are the following: non-governmental organizations from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Ireland as well as the European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control, affiliated with the United Nations (HE-UNI). 
The first research report on forced and sham marriages, along with the definition of a "sham marriage with exploitation elements", are the main project output. 
The HE-UNI has defined, based on national researches (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Ireland), the common and differentiating features in individual countries and outlined recommendations. 
However, the need for further research, especially regarding the third-country nationals entering forced or sham marriages with EU citizens, or serving as persons benefiting from such activities, was identified.

9.3 National projects, campaigns and other activities 
In 2016, several activities, events and training courses were held with a focus on capacity building, the development of the national reference mechanism, the exchange of information, and the raising of awareness of human trafficking. 
The activities did not specifically focus on the target group of victims of human trafficking who are TCNs. 
Since some of them are of a general nature or can be applicable/used with respect to all human trafficking victims irrespective of their citizenship, below is an overview of some of such activities: 
The SR continued to provide the possibility to report potential human trafficking victims or to obtain preventive information on how not to become the victim of this crime through the free National Helpline 0800 800 818 for Victims of Human Trafficking also in 2016. 
This service has been provided continuously since 2008. 
Trafficking in human beings forms an integral part of the preparation of consular staff before being posted abroad, and training activities on this topic are held regularly at half-year intervals. 
Within the pre-departure preparation of consuls, the Information Centre for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Crime Prevention of the Mol SR trained, in cooperation with IOM and MoFEA SR, 30 consuls and other consular staff members of MoFEA SR, on identifying human trafficking victims in 2016.223 
The manual contains an overview of human trafficking issues and group activities, which can be used by professionals to organize effective informational meetings and educational events on human trafficking-related risks. 
IOM launched a new website www.bezpecnecestovanie.iom.sk and published an updated How Not to Get Lost in the World brochure in April 2016. 
The website and brochure are intended for persons travelling or planning to work abroad. 
They direct attention to human trafficking risks and offer advice on how not to become a victim of modern-day slavers and on what to do in a crisis. 
In October 2016, IOM created the SAFE Work & Travel Abroad mobile application, which uses an interactive game to point out human trafficking risks. 
224 It also contains the characteristics of human trafficking, hints for safe travelling abroad, important information on mediation of work or work contracts and useful contacts for emergencies. 
It is freely available at www.safe.iom.sk in Slovak, Czech, Polish, Hungarian, and English language version. 
9.4 Cooperation on bilateral and multilateral level 
In 2015, Slovakia joined, via the Information Centre for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings and Crime Prevention, the TeamWork! project implemented by the Netherlands in preparation for the Trio Presidency in the Council of the EU. 
Besides cooperation with EU countries, the MoI SR cooperates also with USA in the field of human trafficking. 
According to the latest assessment Trafficking in Persons Report, which is annually published by the US Department of State, the SR occurred again in group of countries Tier 1 with regard to fulfilling minimum standards for elimination of trafficking in human beings.

233 Compared to previous years, the Slovak Republic was, however, more active in mainstreaming of migration in development policies, following-up on the legislation (new Act on Development Cooperation), documents and activities prepared/initiated in 2015. 
Syria and neighbouring countries from Near and Middle East were included among the territorial priorities of the Slovak development cooperation. 
Slovakia also offered for Syrian refugees additional 30 scholarships of the Slovak Government. 
10.1 Development cooperation and humanitarian aid 
Alongside providing subsidies, financial contributions and government scholarships, it introduces into Slovak legislation new 
235 New tools with regard to humanitarian aid include humanitarian subsidies and the commissioning of jobs which will enable the SR more flexible reactions to international community requests. 
In reaction to the migration situation, Syria and neighbouring Near and Middle East countries were included in the list of territorial priorities of the Slovak development policy within the document, which created a formal precondition for an individual approach to their needs. 
About a third of the Syrian population is currently refugees, while being a substantial part of irregular migrants from the Near and Middle East regions. 
In 2016, MoFEA SR for the first time started implementing humanitarian projects via Slovak and local non-governmental organizations focused on solving the results of the migration crisis. 
Projects focus mainly on providing the refugee children with basic education and healthcare. 
The SR plans to continue implementing the humanitarian projects in the future. 
The SR humanitarian activities in 2016 focused predominantly on aiding countries and organizations confronted with migration crisis or actively entering related processes, especially in the Balkan route (Greece - establishment of a field hospital, Italy - a financial contribution for the Italian Red Cross, Serbia - recurring deliveries of humanitarian material and provision of financial contributions, Macedonia and Slovenia - supplying the accommodation containers). 
Targeted funding on activities in countries influenced by migration or in source countries (Ethiopia, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan) was provided too. 
Within the V4 countries, Slovakia provided humanitarian aid to a refugee camp in Jordan. 
Slovakia has been long-term engaged also in helping refugees from Afghanistan present on the territory of neighbouring Iran. 
It has been using a microgrant scheme aimed at the education of Afghan refugees for several years. 
In May 2016, Slovakia participated in the World Humanitarian Summit, where it signed up for the decisive commitments of the international community focused on addressing the problems of refugees and forcibly displaced persons as well as respecting international humanitarian law, and to several specific initiatives. 
Apart from that, it declared a series of individual commitments, the implementation of which has already started (amendment to the Income Tax Act in order to involve businesses entities in the provision of material humanitarian aid).240

10. Migration and Development 
In this respect, Slovakia decided to focus on two sectors - health and education in which Slovakia can provide both material and financial assistance as well as professional expertise. 
The education of the children of refugees has become one of the main thematic priorities of the SR humanitarian aid. 
This orientation on education activities within the humanitarian aid was reflected also in the opening of an additional 30 government scholarship places242 for Syrian nationals, who lived in various refugee camps in Near or Middle East countries or were internally displaced persons. 
Following the Resolution, the Slovak Government scholarship was granted to 30 students. 
Students who had arrived to Slovakia in September 2016 started the Slovak language course in the 2016/2017 academic year and will proceed to study at a public university in a selected branch of studies, after the 10-month language course and vocational preparation. 
They were granted temporary residence for that purpose. 
The aim of the Concept of the Government Scholarships Programme is to make the system of granting government scholarships more efficient towards developing countries, both in a territorial and volumic sense, building upon commitment to enhance the effectiveness of the system of the government scholarships set in the Manifesto of the Government of the Slovak Republic for 2016 - 2020. 
The Slovak Presidency of the Council of the EU has also devoted significant attention to the migration and refugee crisis. 
The SR engaged in improving operation of existing common MS EU tools aimed at eliminating the causes of unmanaged migration in the development policy (trust funds244, Financial Instrument for Refugees in Turkey) as well as in negotiations about new instruments (e.g. European Investment Plan). 
At the end of 2016, the SR obtained EU Trust Fund for Africa grant (€2 mil.) for the implementation of the common V4 development project in Kenya245 also aimed at addressing causes of unmanaged migration. 
The SR contributed a total of €13,300,152 in humanitarian aid for refugees in 2016. 
The funding was provided as a humanitarian aid (financial and material) for Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Macedonia, Greece, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, or in the form of humanitarian and development projects aimed at health care and education in Syria and neighbouring countries. 
Slovakia also contributed to multilateral organisations (e.g. IOM €400,000, Word Food Programme €300,000 and UNHCR €600,000) and trust funds, e.

Bibliography 59 
The national annual policy report has been elaborated within the framework of the European Migration Network activities by the EMN National Contact Point in the SR. 
The development of migration has been affected by the global financial crisis in 2009 on the wide scale, mainly the area of labour migration. 
The third-country nationals' migration and integration Steering Board, which was established in 2009, is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the tasks resulting from the Concept of Foreigner Integration in the Slovak Republic and the Concept of Migration Policy of the Slovak Republic. 
Many activities (projects, researches, conferences and workshops) were carried out during the reference period in the area of migration and asylum by the governmental bodies, NGOs and academic sphere. 
Besides the amendment to the Act on Stay of Aliens in connection with the transposition of the Return Directive there were no significant changes of the laws regulating the area of migration and asylum in 2009. 
The year 2009 in the SR was characterised by further decrease of the pressure on the state borders - decline in the number of asylum seekers and reduction of illegal migration (considering the statistics on the recorded cases of illegal migration). 
However, the public was not involved significantly with regards to the discussions. 
Illegal migration, asylum, labour migration and integration of the third-country nationals were issues that attracted most of the media attention.

3.1.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
Legislative developments 
Modifications related to the issuance of visas respond to the Visa Code. 
The same, i. 
e. not requiring residence permit within 90 days after the date of entry, applies for students and third-country nationals carrying out specific activities. 
In terms of the procedure of granting the permanent residence permit, the amendment of the Act on Stay of Aliens regulates unification of certain provisions with the similar provisions related to the issuance of temporary or tolerated residence permit, e.g. by adding the reasons for refusal of application for the permanent residence permit. 
It concerns third-country nationals who fulfil the requirements for issuance of another type of the residence permit. 
In addition, the third-country national may not appeal against issuance of the tolerated residence permit prolongation, de facto against the decision allowing the application. 
The amendment of the Act on Stay of Aliens is planned also in connection with transposition of the High Qualified Workers Directive69. 
Other legislative changes are necessary due to the transposition of the Employers Sanctions Directive1' by 20 July 201 172. 
II(h) an Expulsion Decision taken by one Member State (MS) should be applicable throughout the EU and entered into the SIS/ implementation of Directive 2001/40/EC 
The provisions regarding the decision on the expulsion of third-country nationals issued by any EEA Member State are fully applicable within the SR in accordance with the Council Directive 2001/40/EC of 28 May 2001 on the mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third country nationals. 
The Report on the fulfilment of the measures from the 2008 Schengen Action Plan of the Slovak Republic for the period 2008 - 200913 (hereafter "the Report") stated that there has been qualitative progress on the level of police cooperation in fight against organised crime and in the localisation of missing persons and missing objects via the SIS.

refused entry into the Schengen territory)75. 
In 2009, 1 235 decisions on administrative or judicial expulsion were rendered. 
The administrative or judicial decisions were rendered to the third-country nationals, including the thirdcountry nationals apprehended by the police of the neighbouring state by air by any EU Member State and returned to the SR on the basis of the readmission agreement. 
In total, 953 decisions were executed in 2009, out of which 18 were rendered in 2008 and 938 were rendered in 200976. 
III(a) more effective control of the external land, sea and air borders:77 
The National plan on border control management of the Slovak Republic78 for the period 2007-2013 (hereafter "National Plan") is medium and long term planning document in the area of the EU border control referring to Schengen Action Plan for safeguarding the entry of the SR into the Schengen area79. 
Within the second period, the Slovak Republic committed itself to establish fully functional technical protection of the northern part of the border with Ukraine. 
At present, the development and establishment of the pilot project virtual fence - continues along the state border. 
75 Information provided by the BBAP MoI SR. 
76 Information provided by the BBAP MoI SR. 
Presently, RALEN system is used in case of border controls. 
RALEN system, developed in the Slovak Republic, is unique in the world because it reacts on the biological human body field it reacts 100% on human beings and not for instance on animals. 
RALEN system is one of the portative technical devices regarding the protection of the external Schengen border with Ukraine. 
Measures related to the increase of operative instruments for strengthening the protection of the problematic parts of the external Schengen border are being implemented currently: the SR provided Cessna aircraft in the Aegean Sea (Greek Islands) and Tyrenean Sea (Sicily) in the frame of common FRONTEX activities (RABIT teams). 
III(b) generalise the issue of biometric visas, improve cooperation between MSs' consulates and set up joint consular services for visas: 
In 2009 negotiations regarding the joint consular services for visas took place and the SR was approached by other EU Member States. 
The SR concluded inter-governmental agreement on mutual representation by means of diplomatic missions and consular offices of their countries in the visa granting procedure with Austria. 
Austria will represent the SR in visa issuance procedure in Jordan (Amman) and Lebanon (Beirut). 
The Agreement has not been executed yet, due to the preparation of the implementation protocols. 
III (d) solidarity with MS subjected to disproportionate influxes of immigrants 
III(e) deploy modern technological means for border control 
The EUROSUR81, currently created, represents decisive step in further progress regarding the creation of the integrated European border management system. 
The expectations in respect of the EUROSUR are as follows: to prevent the number of illegal migrants who are able to enter the EU without being subject of detection, to increase the whole interior security of the EU by contributing to the prevention of cross-border crime, to strengthen the searching and rescuing capacities. 
Further information are also in the section 3.1.1 II (c). 
During the meeting of the Frontiers Working Group, so called "mini project" was agreed on and approved by the Member States. 
the 31 August 2009 until 6 September 2009. 
By 12 September 2009, the collected data were sent by e-mail to the General Secretariat of the Council of the EU. 
The Commission will map the heavier burden on particular border crossing points and other data relevant also for development of the thirdcountry national's entry/exit system82. 
For more information, see also section III (a). 
III(f) Intensify cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit in order to strengthen border control 
The priority of the SR, in particular, is to support and strengthen the cooperation with Ukraine in the area of the adherence of the Slovak-Ukrainian border control regime. 
With the FRONTEX Agency approval, the Ukrainian partners participate in the joint operations organized along the Slovak-Ukrainian border. 
In 2009, four Ukrainian border guards (with observer status) took part in the 4- phased JO JUPITER. 
The training activities have been undertaken within the FRONTEX training activities in relation to the neighbouring third countries (Romania, Ukraine, Moldova, etc., and bilateral training activities of the Slovak Republic and Ukraine and Moldova (in cooperation with the EUBAM)). 
The EUBAM supports operational activities, FRONTEX activities and it participates in the incorporation of the IBM model in Moldova and Ukraine by monitoring and providing the border services with professional assistance in cooperation with the FRONTEX Agency. 
The EUBAM and FRONTEX participate in the joint meetings and sessions. 
On the basis of the EUBAM recommendation, the monthly reports CBSAR, elaborated by the Moldovan and Ukrainian partners, are regularly sent to the FRONTEX Agency. 
The EUBAM and the FRONTEX cooperate also in respect to the illegal migration analyses. 
The experts from the SR shall take part in the training activities in the future83. 
According to the statistical data contained in the BBAP MoI SR Yearbook on legal and illegal migration in 200984, 1,785 cases of illegal migration were reported in 2009, which proved a declining tendency85. 
Out of this number, 611 were cases of illegal crossing of the Slovak state border (570 cases of external border crossing in the direction to the SR), and 1,174 were cases of illegal stay in the SR. 
The statistics show that in the majority of cases, the state borders of the Slovak Republic were crossed illegally by the nationals of Moldova (181), Georgia (99), Ukraine (65), Afghanistan (62), Pakistan (47), the Russian Federation (44) and Armenia (24). 
The illegal state border crossing mainly concerned the external land border; only 17 persons attempted to cross the external air border during the reference period.

gling reached 160. 150 persons were suspected of smuggling and 92 of them were exhibited of charge in 43 cases. 
Regarding organized groups of smugglers, in 8 cases charges were brought against 50 smugglers (48 men, 2 women) in 2009. 
In these cases together at least 1513 illegal migrants were smuggled. 
435 persons were extradited from Slovakia, and 43 foreigners were admitted to the SR under readmission. 
The Slovak Republic extradited the majority of the foreigners to Ukraine (425), and admitted 18 foreigners from Ukraine and 17 foreigners from the Czech Republic. 
This category, too, reported a decrease compared to the year 2008, when 1,743 undesirable foreigners were registered. 
Yet, this declining tendency relates to the overall decrease in illegal migration. 
The largest group of persons expelled administratively was made up by the nationals of Ukraine (392), Croatia (234) and Moldova (161); the same applies to judicial expulsion (80 Ukrainian state nationals and 13 Moldovan state nationals). 
The most frequent reason for listing a person as undesirable was his/her illegal entry and stay in the SR (955 cases). 
The statistics are available in the Annex A.I.3.

I(a) Implement policies for labour migration 
The employment of the third-country nationals correlates with the development on the labour market in the SR. 
The MoLSAF SR supports recruitment and employment of the third-country nationals in the SR, only in accordance with the labour market needs, and stresses the employment of the high-qualified employees, research workers, students and other qualified migrants. 
Important factor when assessing employment of the third-country national is the fulfilment of the qualification requirements (the eligibility). 
extent of 5,000 to 11,000 persons per year)106 in the following years. 
Despite this fact, it is necessary to define the scope of the labour migration in the whole context of the migration, as well as, and to clearly define third-country nationals' employment policy on the governmental level in the SR. 
In 2009, however, no concrete measures were adopted in this regard due to the financial crisis. 
In the second half of the year 2010, legislative proposals are expected in connection with the transposition of the High Qualified Workers Directive'07. 
The SR does not implement policy that would aggravate the brain drain from the third countries.

3.4.2 Additional / Complementary Developments 
In 2009, 2656 foreigners were registered with valid work permit in the SR (2039 men and 617 women). 
As of 31 December 2009, there were 15 264108 foreigners in total (including thirdcountry nationals and EU/EEA citizens) registered in the labour market. 
The aim of the project was to identify and define legal shortcomings leading to the low percentage of submitted and successful applications for qualification recognition in the SR, as well as to propose necessary changes of the current Slovak legislation.

The website was created within the project "Feel at Home" financed by the EIF. 
The target group of the project were not only the migrants but also active or prospective employers. 
During the implementation of the project the key questions were identified concerning the potential of the labour migrants and the need for labour migration management. 
The research results will be further processed in the form of recommendations for the elaboration of the quality and long-term migration policy.

February 2010). 
The Concept is based on the EU migration and integration policy principles and it proposes legislative, organizational, conceptual and practical integration measures. 
The aim of the Concept is to implement integration measures contributing to the prevention of emergence of the economic, social and culturally diverse society. 
So called integration mainstreaming is one of the key elements of the Concept in relation to the drafting laws, creating sectoral policies, regulations, and adopting measures. 
It is necessary to reflect the consequences of such measures on the foreigner's integration. 
The Concept defines integration measures in the following areas: 
The proposed measures in the area of the social security scheme are as follows: consistently taking into account the foreigners and their family members needs when preparing and drafting laws in the area of social security scheme in order to reduce and eliminate poverty and prevent social exclusion of the foreigners with the aim of position approximation of the foreigners target group residing legally in the SR with the citizens of the SR, continuously adopting measures related to the improvement of life quality of the foreigners living in the Slovak Republic and keeping categories of foreigners within the groups of potentially vulnerable with regard to the exclusion and poverty. 
Further measures are proposed in the area of access to accommodation and health care, in the area of naturalization and integration of the foreigners into the majority population taking into account the measures related to the civic integration, raising awareness towards foreigners and information - communication strategies. 
The Concept proposes long term legislative and practical measures in the area of integration policy and instruments and mechanisms for cooperation and coordination of the main stakeholder activities in this area. 
The proposed legislative and practical measures in the area of integration define the tasks for the period of upcoming three to five years. 
I(h) Promote information exchange on best practices in terms of reception and integration 
The MoLSAF SR organised the Conference on the integration of the third-country nationals in Slovakia: from the Concept to Integration on 29 June 2009 within the national project of the European Integration Fund for the third-country nationals - "Elaboration of the analyses and recommendations related to the Concept of Foreigner Integration in the Slovak Republic" financed by the EU115. 
The aim of the Conference was to present the Concept of Foreigners Integration in the Slovak Republic from the point of view of implementation of further practical and integration implementation measures. 
The participants at the Conference were representatives of the state administration, regional authorities, international organisations, NGOs, scientific and research organizations, academic sphere and representatives of the third-country nationals living in the SR. 
The Steering Board is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the 
tasks resulting from the Concept of Foreigner Integration in the Slovak Republic (May 2009) and the Concept of Migration Policy in the Slovak Republic (updating planned in 2010), as well as, for policy coordination and positions of the governmental departments towards the EU and other international organizations. 
The Steering Board consists of permanent members (representatives of the relevant Ministries and public institutions) and ad hoc members including NGOs and international organizations, representatives of self-administration and other stakeholders. 
The Migration information Centre IOM was established in order to support social, economic and cultural integration of migrants in the SR. 
In 2009 (March-December), the MIC followed its activities launched in first phase in years 2006 to 2008 under EU initiative Equal. 
During the ten months in 2009, the MIC was addressed by 527 individual clients. 
The main activity was characterised by providing legal counselling. 
The MIC IOM consultants were mainly addressed with the questions related to the resident permits, employment of migrants in the SR, family reunification and family life. 
Within this activity 3 info booklets (Resident permits of foreigners in Slovakia, Employment of foreigners in Slovakia, Citizenship of the SR) were published and distributed in 13.000 copies, and running of the webpage - www.mic.iom.sk, which provides information on important areas of foreigner life the SR, as well as the answers on many questions related to the foreigners and foreigners employment. 
Another activity of the MIC IOM in 2009 was the help with the migrant integration on the labour market. 
Within this activity, 33 financial contributions on education/ new qualification courses were distributed among the migrants. 
The biggest interest was in courses of the Slovak language for foreigners, driving school courses and computer skills courses. 
The individual counselling, which included preparation of the curriculum vitae, orientation on the labour market and assistance in job finding, was requested 
in case of 14 clients. 
The MIC IOM traditionally cooperates with the migrant communities in the SR. 
The cultural mediators organized 13 info meetings for the communities and broad public in different towns of the SR117. 
Within this project the following activities took place: study tours (the Netherlands, the UK, Sweden and Portugal) of the state administration employees (MoLSAF SR, Centre of labour, social affairs and family, BBAP MoI) and self-administration representatives (from Košice, Nitra, Bratislava) in order to extend the knowledge regarding the migration and integration management and their possible application in the SR; 2 workshops on integration, intercultural dialogue and labour migration118 linked to the study tours. 
The text book comprises inputs by study tour and workshops' participants, information on approved policies in countries with longer experience regarding the migrants' integration, methods and approaches resulting in better integration of the migrants. 
On 14 December 2009 a seminar entitled "Migrants' integration - do we know what we want?" took place on which projects of several institutions were presented. 
The Comenius University presented project entitled "Research quality - condition of a successful integration". 
The research was oriented on the specific situation of the migrant women who are more disadvantaged comparing to other groups of migrant. 
The IVO implemented also a project entitled "International cooperation and exchange of the experience in the area of use of integration indicators" financed by the EIF122. 
Within the project, the international expert seminar held on 26 June 2009 in Bratislava en-

The network exchanges professional and practical experience regarding the integration indicators in order to use them at setting the integration policies as well as afterwards information gathering about the level of migrants' integration124. 
Within the approved Concept of Foreigner Integration in the SR several measures were proposed for the upcoming years in the area of citizenship granting. 
Another proposed measure is the re-evaluation and specification of the criteria for the assess- 
e. the acquired level of knowledge according to the international norms of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (CEFR); re-evaluation of the legal definition of a continual permanent residence as a condition for granting of citizenship of the SR and allowance of an exception for violating the period in extraordinary cases according to the law (for instance a study internship abroad, public interest) and other measures. 
There were no changes in legislation on citizenship during the year 2009.

Executive Summary 
The national annual policy report has been elaborated within the framework of the European Migration Network activities by the EMN National Contact Point in the SR. 
The structure and the contents of the chapters follow the specification set by the European Commission. 
The specification is identical for all EU Member States. 
General structure of political and legal system in the Slovak Republic; 3. 
General developments relevant to asylum and migration; 4. 
Border control; 7. 
The Annual Policy Report 2010 comprises also the Annex to national annual policy report 2010 on implementation of commitments of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and Stockholm Programme elaborated on the basis of the specifications. 
The Annex consists further of List of Abbreviations and Bibliography. 
In 2010 there were not any significant changes on political, institutional and legal level that would influence the migration and asylum policy. 
Due to the changes in the government and in the state institutions resulting from the parliamentary elections, creation of a new governing coalition, and also due to the regional elections in 2010 there were not adopted any strategic documents in this area. 
Generally, the financial crisis did not have an impact on the national legislation in the area of migration in 2010. 
The new Government of the SR declared in its Manifesto that it will improve mechanisms of the migration management and foreigners' integration emphasising the harmonization of the processes and policies in this areas with the developments and trends in other EU member states and it will prepare new concept objectives of the migration policy for 2011-2015. 
We can assume that the concept objectives will be approved during 2011 and they will set the priorities and rules in the area of legal and, as well as, labour migration in the SR. 
A number of activities (projects, researches, conferences and workshops) were carried out during the reference period in the area of migration and asylum by the third sector and academic sphere. 
In 2010, there were not any significant changes of legislation governing the area of asylum and migration besides adoption of the Act that amended the Act on Stay of Aliens and the Act on Employment Services. 
The year 2010 in the SR was characterised, according to statistics, by further decrease of the pressure on the state borders - decline in the number of asylum seekers (decrease by more than one third comparing to 2009) and reduction of illegal migration (comparing to 2009 there was reported decrease in number of illegal border crossings and in number of persons detained in the Police detention centres for foreigners (PDCF)). 
Illegal migration, asylum, questions related to the labour immigration of the third-country nationals were issues that attracted most of the media attention. 
The report provides a brief overview of media monitoring in this field. 
01. Introduction: Purpose and Methodology Followed 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2010 - Slovak Republic 
and Methodology Followed 
The EMN Annual Policy Report is a basis for elaboration of the 2nd Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum in the European Union 2010 by the European Commission1, and therefore, it contains besides ten chapters also an Annex on implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and Stockholm Programme, which was elaborated according to the form provided beforehand. 
The report describes developments in the reference period from 1 January 2010 until 31 December 2010. 
In ten chapters2 this report refers to the development regarding the implementation of the EU legislation into the Slovak national law, as well as, to the influence of the EU policies in the area of asylum and migration in the SR. 
The germane statistics are incorporated in the Annex on implementation of the European Pact 
1 Second Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum in the European Union 2010 will be presented by the Commission to Council in June 2011. 
3. General developments relevant to asylum and migration; 
The BBAP MoI SR and MO MoI SR, MoLSAF SR, Office of the Labour, Social Affairs and Family, MoFA SR, Statistical Office of the SR and the IOM provided information and statistical data. 
The consultation and information on the media monitoring were provided by the representatives of the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights. 
The Public Defender of Rights provided information on his activities in relation to the migrants and asylum seekers. 
Of significant importance were the websites of key stakeholders - state, international and nongovernmental institutions, as well as, materials and booklets, they published. 
Since the literature dealing with asylum and 
These specifications require providing information only on significant development, parliament debates and media reports which had impact on development in the area of migration and asylum. 
1.2 Terms and Definitions 
If this was not possible for some term(s), or they did not exist in the Glossary, then the terms from the national legislation were used. 
Provided the national legislation did not contain particular 
terms, the terms used by the EU legislation (Directives, Regulations) were used. 
This legal definition implies that according to the national legislation the aliens are also the citizens of the EEA (or EU), as well as, thirdcountry nationals; whereas the EU legislation distinguishes following categories of persons: EU citizens, third-country nationals. 
The term "third-country national"3 is used in the Report as given in the EMN Glossary4, i.e. any person who is not a citizen of the Union within the meaning of the Article 20 of the Treaty on Functioning of the European Union, including stateless persons. 
3 Third country is a country or territory other than one within the European Union. 
This definition is given in the EMN Glossary; however, definition of a third-country is lacking in the Slovak national legal order.

ing unemployment in the SR as a result of the global financial crisis. 
Generally, the financial crisis did not have impact on the national legislation in this area in 2009 neither in 2010. 
Further information is available in the Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2009 Slovak Republic87. 
Although the economic crisis contributed to the change of attitudes towards the immigration, in particular, as regards the labour market needs in the SR, the scope of labour migration was not limited and it correlated with the labour market needs. 
An amendment of the Act on Stay of Aliens and Act on Employment Services entered into force on 15 January 2010.

and Stockholm Programme. 
The Institute for Public Affairs published in 2010 a booklet entitled "Probes into the cultural diversity of Slovakia"89. 
The publication was published within the project Cultural diversity in Slovakia in the context of labour migration: trends and challenges for public policy, which was financed from the financial mechanism of the EEA, Nordic financial mechanism and state budget of the Slovak Republic. 
The main aim of this publication is to present different types of economic migration and cultural dialogue between migrants and native population. 
The understanding of these phenomena can lead to the justified claims to the public policy and strengthening of the positive trends.

4.1.3 Developments from the EU perspective 
Labour migration management focused on the compensation of the lack of available labour force in the labour market, primarily in problematic sectors where shortage professions exist. 
The SR supports labour migration while maintaining the conditions that the vacancies are filled by the registered job seekers, job seekers with the Slovak citizenship and EU/EEA citizens and citizens of the Swiss confederation and only subsequently by the third-country nationals. 
Regarding the transposition of the EU Blue Card Directive, a new Act on Border Controls and Stay of Aliens was prepared in the second half of 2010. 
The EU Blue Cards shall enhance the entry and residence of the third-country nationals who will come to the SR to conduct highqualified employment under conditions set by the Directive. 
At the same time the change of conditions regarding the residence of family members of the high-qualified workers is foreseen, in order to calculate first five years of the family members' residence, required in order to gain separate residence permit, accumulate the residence in the Member States. 
The accumulation of periods of residence in different Member States by the EU Blue Card holders shall apply mutatis mutandis in order to fulfil the requirements for obtaining long-term residence permit.

The programmes of assisted voluntary returns had been implemented in SR in co-operation with the IOM since 1998, based on the Agreement on Cooperation between the International Organization for Migration and the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic on the Assistance to the Rejected Asylum Seekers and Illegal Migrants with the Return to the Country of Origin as of 20 August 1998. 
Legal base for the assisted voluntary returns is, besides the above mentioned agreement, the Act on Stay of Aliens and Act on Asylum. 
Assisted voluntary returns are implemented exclusively by the IOM. 
In 2009, there were implemented several projects in the area of voluntary returns in cooperation with the IOM and the BBAP MoI SR. 
The objective of these projects is to enhance the assistance in voluntary returns to the country of origin, improvement of the counselling services, spreading of the information about the voluntary returns programme, building capacities, enhancing cooperation with the state institutions and providing the voluntary return programme to the utmost group of migrants. 
Further information is available in the Annex on implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and Stockholm Programme. 
5.2.2 Developments within the national perspective 
The voluntary returns are currently implemented with the financial support of the RF (European Return Fund). 
In addition to the return and return assistance, the IOM provides the information campaign, pre-departure counselling, stabilisation allowances on the basis of approved business plan on reintegration assistance in the country of origin that significantly contributes to the sustainable return. 
The IOM implemented following projects in the area of voluntary returns in 2010: 
Projects co-funded by the Return Preparatory Actions: 
1) „Strengthening the mechanisms and harmonising the standards in the area of voluntary returns of the illegal migrants in the central EU Member States"; 
2) „Assistance during the return and reintegration of the unsuccessful asylum seekers and illegal migrants from the SR to the country of origin (phase I)"; 
3) „ Assistance during the return and reintegration of the unsuccessful asylum seekers and illegal migrants from the SR to the country origin (phase 2"). 
In the framework of the aforementioned projects, there were 130 foreigners returned to the country of origin in 2010. 
Reintegration assistance was provided to 33 migrants118. 
The Agreement between the European Union and Georgia on readmission of persons residing without authorisation is prepared for signing (with the aim to effectively return their own citizens, third-country nationals or stateless persons). 
The Government of the SR concluded and signed in the reference period bilateral protocols implementing following agreements on the EU level: 
• Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation 
• Agreement between the European Community and the Russian Federation on readmission

and the Republic of Moldova on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. 
On bilateral level, operational border meetings on detection of smuggling with the elements of organised crime were organised in the cooperation with the Ukrainian State Border Services Authority and the BBAP MoI SR. 
Constant meetings and operational information exchange on joint semi-finished organised illegal migration and smuggling cases are the evidence of the intense cooperation between police forces of the EU Member States. 
The cooperation is on bilateral and multilateral level in the form of membership in the Europol analysis files, Interpol, and active involvement in the COSPOL initiatives, and in the regional cooperation: "Danube Region". 
A project entitled "Rendition of complex reintegration assistance and educational activities in the area of prevention and capacity building of cooperating subjects of the Programme of Support and Protection of Victims ofTrafficking in Human Beings in the SR" was implemented within a Programme of return and reintegration of the trafficked persons in 2009. 
1073 calls in 2009120. 
5.3.2 Developments within the national perspective 
Until now, there has not been identified any foreign victim of human beings trafficking in the SR and it has not been proved by any clear and convincing evidence that the SR would be a transit country. 
One part of the project was also provision of the National Anti-Trafficking Hotline 
All together there were received 434 calls out of which in 234 cases the telephonic consultations were provided. 
Out of the total number of phone calls, 200 calls represented the case of sole contact of the operator with the contact person. 
The telephonic consultation was not carried out due to the misdial or abuse of the hotline. 
Thanks to the National Anti-Trafficking Hotline eleven persons were identified in 2010 who were victims of trafficking in human beings in the past or during the call they were in a situation of human being trafficking threat. 
To these persons, thanks to the hotline, the crisis intervention and assistance was provided in order to release them from the criminal environment and to offer them to join the programme. 
Another result of the cooperation and co-funding with the MoI SR were the trainings aimed at identification of the victims of the human beings trafficking. 
Within the organized activities there were 15 two-/three-day trainings for 386 participants.

Further information is available in the Annex on implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and Stockholm Programme. 
6.1.2 Developments within the national perspective 
Since the SR is part of the Schengen Area from 2007 there have not been any other developments on national level than those described in part 6.1.3 in relation to the control and protection of the external borders. 
In 2010 there were not implemented any broader or significant organizational changes in case of border police in relation to the controls on external borders. 
6.1.3 Developments from the EU perspective 
Due to the financial cuts resulting from the global economic crisis in 2010, the supply of new technologies, to be implemented during external border controls, was limited. 
Despite this fact, in 2010, the international airports, border crossing points on Slovak-Ukraine border and selected organizational parts of the BBAP Mol SR were equipped with specialised technical devices used for travel documents and identification documents control. 
At the same time, the customs authorities were equipped with special devices for tasks' fulfilment with the aim to detect the illegal border crossing at the external borders of the EU. 
The National unit for the fight against illegal migration of the BBAP Mol SR was equipped with the service cars and special observer motor vehicles for the purpose of external border control and detection of illegal migration and crimes related to it (e.g. smuggling). 
There was also funded part of the costs with respect to the provision of the user support, legislative and technical support for the national part of the Visa Information System of the MoFA SR. 
In 2010, the information system for migration and international protection called "IS MIGRA" was implemented with the aim to gather qualitative and complex information on illegal migration in the SR. 
IS MIGRA is analytical, evidence based system proposed for the recording of the operations with respect to the foreigners at the borders, within the territory, including foreigners in asylum procedure and recording of the operations regarding the smugglers. 
The importance of the IS MIGRA is in identification of the persons through their fingerprints stored in the IS MIGRA and in the interconnection with other information systems of the Police Force. 
Pilot version of the IS MIGRA was launched on 26 October 2010. 
6.2 Cooperation with respect to border control

Further information is available in the Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2009 Slovak Republic. 
7.2 Developments within the national perspective 
The most fundamental issue concerning refugee migration in the SR was a clear decrease in the number of filed applications for asylum comparing to previous periods127. 
Compared to the previous years, the number of asylum seekers granted asylum was stabilized - in 2010 the asylum was granted to 10 asylum seekers128 by the MO MoI SR and in 2009 to 14 asylum seekers (for comparison: in 2008, 22 asylums were granted, in 2006 - 8 asylums). 
However, on the other hand the, MO MoI SR granted 55 subsidiary protections in total which constitutes decrease by 43 cases comparing to 2009. 
In 2010, the procedure was suspended in 360 cases, and no asylum was granted in 178 cases which constitutes a decrease comparing to 2009 when an asylum was not granted in 330 cases129. 
127 822 persons applied for asylum in the SR in year 2009, in 2008, 909 persons applied for asylum in the SR, in year 2007 it were 2,643 persons, in year 2006, it were 2, 849 persons and for comparison in year 2004, it were 11, 395 persons.

10.2 Experiences, debates in the (non-) implementation of EU legislation 
LEGAL IMMIGRATION AND INTEGRATION 
1. Economic migration 
1.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
The relevant commitments in the Pact for this sub-section are in particular: 
I (a) Implement policies for labour migration 
The Slovak Republic (SR) did not adopt any new policies or strategies regarding the enhancement of management of third-country nationals' labour migration into the SR in 2010. 
In accordance with the Pact, the labour migration was regulated by the labour market needs and the preference of the EU citizens. 
In comparison to other EU Member States, the SR does not regulate legal migration from the third countries by setting up the quotas for specific groups of economic migrants or by establishing a list of professions according to the labour market's needs in particular sectors. 
Local Offices ofLabour, Social Affairs and Family issued in total 2 700 work permits from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010, out of which 1210 were prolongations. 
132 Information provided by the Centre of Labour, Social Affairs and Family (ÚPSVR). 
for third-country national workers' admission and employment in the Slovak Republic in accordance with labour market needs, in particular, support of admission of high-qualified workers, researches, students, as well as, qualified migrants. 
The new Slovak Government, appointed after the Parliamentary elections held on 12 June 2010, stated in its Manifesto134 that it will take steps to improve the quality of mechanisms for managing the migration and integration of foreigners, placing emphasis on the alignment and harmonisation of relevant procedures and policies with the developments and trends in other EU Member States and will prepare policy concepts for the migration policy of the Slovak Republic in the period of 2011 - 2015135. 
It is reasonable to assume that policy concepts for the migration policy will be approved during 2011 and they will set the priorities and rules in the area of legal migration, as well as labour migration and access to the labour market in the SR by labour migrants from third countries. 
The Slovak Republic should have a legal migration policy aimed at attraction of the high-qualified migrants from culturally close countries, according to the politicians' reflections136. 
Regarding the planned changes to the policies, it is possible to state, that after the SR accession to the EU there was an increased interest in the SR. 
The SR, besides being traditionally a transit country, has become gradually also a destination country137 for some migrants. 
The impact of economic crisis significantly influenced the situation on labour market in SR also in 2010, according to the information of the MoLSAF SR. 
Despite expected economic growth, being estimated up to 4% in 2010, the area of employment encountered huge problems which resulted in further employment decrease and increase of labour productivity without creation of new jobs. 
This is reflected also in the area of legal immigration, in particular with respect to the employment of foreigners. 
Although the economic crisis contributed to the change of attitudes towards the immigration, as regards the labour market needs in the SR, the volume of labour migration has not been limited yet, and it has been demand-driven. 
Labour migration management focused on the compensation of the lack of available labour force in the labour market, primarily in problematic sectors where shortage professions exist. 
The foreigners' employment increased at the end of the third quarter of 2010 by 20% yoy. 
Regarding the residence, the amendment of the Act on Stay of Aliens provided for possibilities of issuance of the temporary residence permit for the business purposes to the foreigner acting in the name of a business company or a cooperative society. 
The work permit is not required with respect to 
138 Information provided by the MoLSAF SR. 
- works for an important foreign investor in the Slovak Republic, 
- was seconded to the Slovak Republic by an employer headquartered in another Member State of the European Union as part of service provision by such employer, 
- has been employed in an international passenger transport and sent to carry out his/her duties in the territory of the Slovak Republic by his/her foreign employer, or 
By this amendment, the migration risks with regards to the uncontrolled access of third-country nationals to the Slovak labour market were eliminated in particular by limiting the categories of foreigners who do not need a work permit. 
In accordance with the employment policy and active policy of the labour market the focus was on the promotion of disadvantaged groups' integration in the labour market, to which belong also refugees with granted asylum and migrants142. 
Currently, the new law on stay of aliens is in the process of preparation143. 
The part of this process is also the transposition of the Employers Sanctions Directive144. 
The Directive shall be implemented by 20 July 2011, and therefore, assumed date of entering into force of the new act on stay of aliens is the first half of 2011. 
The preparation of amendments of various laws (under competence of MoLSAF SR - Act on Employment Services, Labour Code, Act on Illegal Work and Illegal Employment) is in process in connection with the transposition of the Employers Sanctions Directive and EU Blue Card Directive. 
With respect to the Employers Sanctions Directive the Ministry of Justice of the SR is preparing the amendment of the Criminal Code. 
I(b) Increase the attractiveness of the EU for highly qualified workers and further facilitate the reception of students and researchers:

The Act on Stay of Aliens shall be amended in order to transpose the directive as follows: the employers' obligation to inform the police unit on beginning of employment of third-country national in given period should be established, as well as the obligation to pay all costs related to the return of the third-country national without any respect to the fact that the third-country national has or has not any own financial means. 
At the same time the Act on Stay of Aliens shall regulate the possibilities to grant the temporary residence permit in case the third-country national is a victim of illegal employment under specifically exploiting labour conditions or in the case of illegal employment of the minors.

The project „Economic Aspects of the migration and integration of the third-country nationals in the Slovak Republic" was implemented by the Institute for the Public Affairs (IVO) in the framework of the EIF in 2010,while continuing in 2011 as well. 
It is a research project focused on mapping of the economic aspects of the migration and integration of the migrants from third countries in the Slovak environment, and at the same time creating the basis for the future comparison146. 
The Agreement between the Slovak Republic and Canada on youth exchange was signed on 20 August 2010 in order to increase the possibilities for young citizens of both states to complete their higher vocational education or university education, or training connected to internship, or work stay, and thus, gaining work experience. 
The Agreement covers university graduates, students enrolled at universities in home country to fulfil their academic study plan with the possibility of internship or employment. 
The Agreement shall come into force after approval by the National Council of the Slovak Republic (Slovak Parliament) and by the Canadian Parliament and it shall be applicable in 2011. 
The EU Blue Card Directive148 is going to be transposed by the new act on stay of aliens which is being under preparation. 
The changes related to the transposition of the Directive are as follows: change of conditions to be fulfilled in order to be granted the residence permit for high-qualified workers. 
The new act on stay of aliens shall embedded possibilities to gain the residence permit for high-qualified workers for four years. 
The amendment of the law envisages for this category of foreigners issuance of a new type of residence document so called "EU Blue Card"from 1 to 4 years, or for shorter period than 1 year in relation to labour contract validity. 
At the same time the change of conditions regarding the residence of family members of the high-qualified workers is foreseen, in order to calculate first five years of the family members' residence, required in order to gain separate residence permit, accumulate the residence in the Member States. 
The accumulation of periods of residence in different Member States by the EU Blue Card holders shall apply mutatis mutandis in order to fulfil the requirements for obtaining long-term residence permit.

149 Information provided by the BBAP MoI SR. 
With respect to the statistical data, the Centre of Labour, Social Affairs and Family does not gather data, in particular, on high-qualified workers or researches. 
According to the employment classification (KZAM) the data are gathered on employed foreigners in groups 0 to 9, whereas the groups 1 and 3 could be regarded as high-qualified workers and group 2 as researches: 
Categories of employees 
EU citizens 
Foreigners (Information card holders) IC_NON-EU 
Third-country nationals with permits 
High-qualified workers (KZAM - group 1) 
Researches (KZAM - group 2) 
High-qualified (KZAM - group 3) 
In total 
The above stated numbers are the total number of foreigners and EU citizens according to the aforementioned groups (KZAM 1,2,3) by 31 December 2010151. 
ATE can employ a foreigner only for their needs it cannot temporarily transfer a foreigner to other employer - "user" employer because the work permit is valid only for concrete employer and concrete type of activity and working place. 
Due to that fact, the number of third-country citizens employed by the Slovak ATE is zero. 
I(c) do not aggravate the brain drain 
As results from the aforementioned under Pact's commitments I (a) and I (b), the Slovak Republic does not implement policy that would aggravate the brain drain from third countries. 
Therefore, there were not adopted any measures to decrease the phenomenon of the "brain drain" from the third countries on the ministerial level in 2010. 
Similarly, there was not approved any strategy with respect to the circular migration or support for "brain circulation" that would constitute in practice the promotion of temporary return of the high-qualified migrants to the countries of origin in order to mitigate the consequences of the "brain drain" phenomenon. 
Further information on circular and temporary migration is available in the EMN study elaborated during 20 1 0152. 
The Slovak Republic is one of those countries, whose labour market is negatively affected by the "brain drain" - i.e. by departure of the qualified and high-qualified workers to other EU Member States or other countries of the OECD.

1.2 Stockholm Programme 
1(b) Improving skills recognition and labour matching 
In the course of employment, the recognition of qualifications is up to the employer depending on the qualification requirements related to the vacancy. 
The Union preference (former principle of Community preference) was applied as well. 
As a result of a negative impact of economic crisis on the labour market in the SR, the situation on the labour market is judged more thoroughly, as well as, with respect to the fulfilment of the qualification criteria in course of employment153. 
In case of labour force shortages in particular sectors of the national economy there is not any comprehensive state strategy in the SR, which would aim to resolve the structural incongruities between labour demand and supply of labour in the labour market154.

2. Family Reunification 
2.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
1(d) to regulate family migration more effectively 
These reasons comprise cases when a foreigner provides false, incomplete or misleading information; or submits false or forged; or documents of another person; or if the information in the travel document of the foreigner does not correspond with the reality. 
With respect to the family migration and consideration of the integration criteria, taken into account during the decision-making on the application, it is necessary to mention that the Act on Stay of Aliens regulates in the Article 23 the cases when it is possible to grant a temporary residence permit to a foreigner for the purpose of family reunification. 
While deciding on temporary residence application for the purpose of family reunification, the interests of minor child of foreigner, personal and family relations, foreigner's financial situation, duration of previous residence, as well as, duration of the presuming residence in the SR are taken into account besides fulfilment of all other legal requirements. 
The Article 34 of the Act on Stay of Aliens stipulates when it is possible to issue a permanent residence permit for the first time for five years ("first permit") for the purpose of family reunification. 
While deciding on permanent residence application a police unit shall consider the integration of the foreigner into the society. 
In case of another (subsequent) request for a permanent residence permit for an unlimited period of time, a police unite may request a certificate on undertaking of the Slovak language course in order to consider the extent of integration into the society.

3.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
I(e) to strengthen mutual information on migration by improving existing instruments where necessary; 
The SR takes part in the information exchange systems on the EU level. 
Within the FRAN cooperation 2-month FRAN analyses reports are monthly uploaded and monthly FRAN statistics are uploaded to the ICONET group of the CIRCA network. 
The States are obliged to fill these documents according to set plan into a specific file of the ICONET in agreed time. 
The information exchange on the multilateral level on illegal migration occurred between the Slovak Republic, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine within the DSR/MSR „Daily Statistics Reports/ Monthly Statistics Reports". 
The information exchange on daily and monthly bases is related to the illegal state border crossings, readmission, trafficking. 
Information is registered by the national contact points which compare their own statistical data with data provided by other participating states. 
The analyses are created on the monthly basis regarding the possible threats to the external land border. 
Project HERMES 
The URAS ASMC BBAP MoI SR participated on Belgian Federal Police project "Hermes" which aim was to map the migration flows on the main land, railway and water routs in 2010. 
The result of this project should be a map of migratory routs in order to provide quality overview of the internal illegal migration in the EU. 
The Statistical Office of the SR provides yearly information on illegal migration to the Eurostat through the questionnaire „International Migration Data Collection" according to the Article 3 of the Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community statistics on migration and international protection. 
For the first time the "Migration Metadata and Quality Questionnaire" was provided to the Eurostat in 2008. 
This questionnaire was elaborated by the Eurostat in order to compare the conformity with the requirements of the Article 3 of the Regulation on statistics on migration and international protection. 
The EU Member States provided information through this questionnaire on sources of the used data, causes for selection of this sources and the impact of sources selection on statistic quality. 
The Metadata collected through this questionnaire are used for analysis of reliability, coherence and comparability level. 
In addition, the summary of this information is used for preparation of methodology files on the Eurostat level, including information regarding the terms of definitions, concepts and quality. 
The information exchange on bilateral level regarding migration occurred through transport of the statistical data and analytical products to the analyses unit in the Czech Republic, as well as the exchange of the monthly statistics and analyses products to the German police attaché in the SR. 
Also through the European Migration Network ad-hoc queries, the information exchange on legal and illegal migration was taking place. 
This information is consequently confronted with the outputs of Europol, EUBAM and so on. 
The SR provided information on residence and employment of the foreigners to the European Immigration Portal. 
I(f) Improve information on the possibilities and conditions of legal migration 
The SR actualized data that should be publicised by the Commission of the EU on EU Immigration Portal at the end of 2010.

4. Integration 
4.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
I(g) Promote harmonious integration in line with the common basic principles 
Due to the elections to the higher administrative authorities and personal changes as a result at the end of the 2009 and due to the parliamentary elections and municipalities elections during 2010 there were not any significant results162, in general, with respect to the implementation of the Concept on Foreigner Integration in the SR163, in particular regarding to the proposed legislative, organizational, conceptual and practical integration measures and defined tasks for the upcoming 3-5 years. 
Negative impact in this regard constituted also organizational changes of the MoLSAF SR during 2010 - primarily the abolition of the Department for the Migration and Integration of Foreigners of the MoLSAF SR and division of the agenda within the section of international relations between two departments by 1 April 2010, as well as further organizational changes as of 1 November 2010 that transferred the agenda of foreigners integration to the Department of gender equality and equal opportunities of the MoLSAF SR. 
In the area of language preparedness of adult foreigners, the work on institutionalization and formalisation of the Slovak language courses and cultural orientations for groups of foreigners, who are able of integration, is intensified. 
This programme is funded fully by the MoESRS SR and it is implemented in an e-learning from on A1 and A2 level.

E-KU Institute of language and cultural communication implemented in 2010 the project aimed at language and intercultural preparation of the third-country nationals in West Slovakia region. 
The particular goal was the lingual integration of the migrants which should be attained by the free of charge courses of the Slovak language for the third-country nationals with legal residence in the SR - in West Slovakia region165. 
The free of charge courses of the Slovak language as the form of assistance to migrants, usually funded by the EU funds, were also provided by the non-governmental organizations. 
The IOM provided language course for the foreigners, which were funded by the financial resources of the EIF, in 2010. 
Since 1 November 2010, the 4th phase of the Migration Information Centre IOM project was approved within the annual programme 2010 EIF. 
The project is co-financed by the European Union (EIF) and by the Ministry of Interior of the SR (state budget). 
Immigrants, the representatives of communities of foreigners living in the Slovak Republic, had an opportunity to opine on the proposed integration measures, during the preparation of the Concept on Foreigner Integration in the SR in 2009. 
The project of the CVEK (Centre for ethnicity and culture research)"Integration of the third-country nationals on the local level - the municipalities and other stakeholders' tasks in this process" was undertaken in 2010 within the EIF funding with continuation foreseen in 2011. 
The integration of the persons with granted subsidiary protection is in compliance with the Concept on Foreigner Integration in the SR that was approved by the Government of the SR in May 2009. 
Integration of these persons includes language preparation (language courses), access to the employment, social and medical service, as well as, to the accommodation. 
166 Information provided by the MoLSAF SR. 
The 5th working group for integration of migrants could be regarded as the forum for integration of migrants on inter-departmental level. 
This working group met only once during 2010 (in March), and therefore, it is not possible to evaluate the results of its activities or the overall asset. 
3(b) to incorporate integration issues in a comprehensive way in all relevant policy areas 
So called integration mainstreaming is one of the key elements of the Concept on Foreigner Integration in the SR in relation to the drafting laws, creating sectoral policies, regulations, and adopting measures. 
It is necessary to reflect the consequences of such measures on the foreigner's integration. 
Each year there should be a report on the state of implementation of the commitments of the Concept on Foreigner Integration in the SR

Latin American, Turkish, and from the community of Islam women. 
Through the information meetings of the communities they celebrated big feast days, such as: New Year Eve (Nawroz - Afghanistan) or All Saints Day (Dia de los muertos - Latin American community). 
For the second time, the big sport and cultural meeting of three of the communities (Afghan, Vietnamese and African) was held during 2010. 
Female cultural mediators gradually took part in the activities and in 2010 they organized together 4 meetings only for women. 
The Milan Šimečka Foundation (in partnership with CVEK) undertook a project in 2010 that will continue also in 2011 with the aim to create a program of continual learning of the educators accredited by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR. 
There are two priority goals of the programme, i. 
e. to develop the educators' competencies - knowledge, skills and attitudes needed for integration of the children of foreigners into the classroom and schools environment, as well as to prepare the teachers for the application of newly gained knowledge, strategies and processes for adaptation of the forms and content of education in classrooms in which the children of foreigners are. 
The part of the programme will comprise also elaboration and presentation of the "Educational plan for the children of Foreigners who took part in that programme". 
The final output of the project will be a symposium organized for the policy-makers in the area of education and integration during which the gained knowledge and experience will be presented to the laymen and experts in the public174. 
The target of the project is to contribute to integration of the third-country nationals into the Slovak society by provision of the effective and comprehensive legal assistance and counselling to the migrants with legal residence in the SR. 
Specifically, the aim of the project focused on assistance to the unaccompanied minors and on search for sustainable solutions of their situation175.

8. Control and surveillance at external borders 
8.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
The relevant commitments in the Pact for this sub-section are in particular: 
lll(a) more effective control of the external land, sea and air borders: 
The second phase of the project on education of border guards and alien police officers of the Border Police Directorate in Sobrance and on the international airports was funded by the European External Borders Fund in English language in order to facilitate the border control activities. 
The provision of new technologies on external borders control was limited by the MoI SR in 2010. 
For these reasons the building-up of further planned route so called "Virtual Fence" in the north part of the external border of the SR with Ukraine was temporary suspended. 
The procurement of the technical devices for the authorities responsible regarding the border control in the SR in 2010 was realized in the framework of annual programmes 2007-2009 of the European External Borders Fund. 
In 2010, the extension of the logistics with respect to the travel and identity documents control on external border occurred by using high-specialised devices. 
These devices of new generation VSC 6000, VSC 4 with IT, comparative devices comprise trinocular stereoscopic microscope. 
With the aforementioned technical devices the international airports, border crossing points on Slovak-Ukraine border and selected organizational parts of the BBAP MoI SR were equipped. 
At the same time, the customs authorities were equipped with special devices (travel documents readers, fiberscopes, and thermal cameras) for tasks' fulfilment during the control of persons crossing the external border of the SR with Ukraine and at the airports, with the aim to detect the illegal border crossing at the external borders of the EU. 
The National unite for the fight against illegal migration of the BBAP MoI SR was equipped with the service cars and special observer motor vehicles for the purpose of external border control and detection of illegal migration and crimes related to it (e.g. smuggling). 
In 2010, the information system for migration and international protection called "IS MIGRA" was implemented and it comprises two parts: 
"Migra I"- for the BBAP MoI SR and MO MoI SR to make evidence of: 
- acts related to the treatment of foreigners at external border and on the territory of the SR 
- during asylum proceedings of the third-country nationals or 
- persons with the right to free movement except the citizens of the SR. 
In this relation the finger prints scanners were provided to the organizational units of the BBAP MoI SR. 
188 Information provided by the BBAP MoI SR. 
7(i) invites the Member States and the Commission to explore how the different types of checks carried out at the external border can be better coordinated, integrated and rationalised with a view to the twin objective of facilitating access and improving security. 
The Slovak Republic took part in the pilot project European Border Surveillance System - EUROSUR through operational centre of the Department of Border Police in Sobrance, also in 2010. 
With this respect it is needed to build up also national coordination centre (NCC) which would be able to communicate with the European network NCC, in the future.

The aforementioned team was deployed with the technical devices on the Greek-Turkish border due to the unbearable situation with respect to the illegal immigration. 
The members of the rapid border intervention teams operated there with the police officers from the EU Member States in period from 6 November to 20 December 2010. 
In total, there will be deployed 176 police officers from the EU Member States on the Greek-Turkish border. 
The basic idea of the joint operation is to enhance border controls on the south-east illegal migration routes in order to collect data on organized groups, false documents, etc. 
In 2010, the BBAP MoI SR provided its expert on false and forged travel documents within the joint operation of the FRONTEX called "Poseidon 2010". 
The purpose of this joint action originated from the goals of the regional programme Poseidon 2009 - 2010 that was approved on 8 December 2009. 
The main aims of this operation comprise the enhancement of the general effectiveness of the border controls on the Greek-Turkish sea border including controls on the border crossing points, border surveillance in order to prevent illegal border crossings, fight against cross-border criminality and adoption of the measures against persons who have crossed the state border illegally. 
Specific goals of the joint operation are as follows: 
• raising the standard of border controls regarding to the detection of false and forged documents, visas (trainings on first line check and second line check of the documents, support of the border guards in capacity building, cooperation during the document controls, etc.), 
• increasing of the quality of reporting related to the detection and interception of the subject in certain operational areas. 
III(f) intensify cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit in order to strengthen border control 
As observers, selected police officers from the third-countries, Moldova and Ukraine, took part in the joint land FRONTEX operation called "Jupiter" covered by the BBAP MoI SR in the period from March 2010 to November 2010.

The BBAP MoI SR took part in the project on capacity building and cooperation with respect to the false and forged documents identification on Moldovan-Romanian border. 
23 officers of the Ukrainian authorities responsible for the issuance and control of the travel and identification documents were trained within the project "Schengen and protection of the external EU border on the Slovak-Ukrainian border" organized by the Slovak Foreign Policy Association. 
9.2 Stockholm Programme 
6(a) The European Council encourages the Commission and Member States to take advantage of the entry into force of the Visa Code and the gradual roll-out of the VIS 
See also section III (b). 
The VIS was used on national level since September 2007 and is fully functional since the Accession of the SR to the Schengen Area (21 December 2007). 
The national VIS SR has two parts: NS VIS MZV SR and NS VIS MV SR which are in production functioning and in relation to CS VIS work in a regime that take into account the absence of the CS VIS. 
NS VIS MoFA SR is used for visa application admission, issuance of visa on the crossing points and airports, databases of issued visas of the SR, communication with CS VIS and provision of communication with CS VIS for relevant systems. 
Central access point for the SR is within the MoFA SR. 
Implementation of the old VISION system to the new VISION system is developed within the Decision of the Council 2009/1024/EU of 22 December 2009 (technical specification). 
The change of the VIS system occurred also within the MoFA SR. 
At the same time, police officers who are using the system VIS were trained with respect to the changed system VIS, as well as from the whole Visa Code. 
The VIS system within the MoI SR is created according to the tasks and deadlines set by the European Commission. 
ASYLUM 
10. International Protection 
10.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
IV(c) solidarity with MS which are faced with specific and disproportionate pressures on their national asylum systems: 
The SR supports harmonization through increased practical cooperation and practice knowledge exchange between the EU Member States, however, there is no information available from this area at the moment. 
The main tasks of the EASO shall be coordination and support of practical cooperation between the EU Member States, common educational system, platform on country of origin information (COI), asylum support teams and activities enhancing solidarity. 
The SR, via the MO MoI SR, is actively involved into the pilot project EUREMA "refugees relocations from Malta within the EU" funded by the European refugee fund. 
The project is carried out in the period from January 2010 to June 2011. 
The goal of the SR is to internally relocate 10 persons with granted international protection, while the target groups are the families with children and single parents with children. 
Currently, a selection process of the appropriate candidates takes place in Malta by Maltese authorities in order to relocate them internally to the SR. 
The Grant Contract was signed by the SR at the end of September 2010. 
They stayed in the SR for 6 months, after that period of time, they were resettled to the target third country. 
This activity was highly appreciated by the UNHCR, American Embassy, as well as on the world forums.

GLOBAL APPROACH TO MIGRATION 
V(a) conclude EU-level or bilateral agreements with the countries of origin and of transit containing clause on legal and illegal migration as well as development 
With respect to bilateral readmission agreements with third countries; the SR has agreements in force with following third countries: Ukraine (the provisions of the Agreement on the EU level take precedence over this agreement, i.e. bilateral agreement and the implementing protocol are partly 
Due to the economic crisis the situation on the Slovak labour market significantly deteriorated and this became evident by decrease of employment rate and increase of unemployment rate by almost 50%. 
The SR does not have and does not plan any measures focusing on labour or circular migration192. 
V(c) cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit in order to deter or prevent illegal immigration 
The BBAP MoI SR does not cooperate with the third countries of origin or transit in order to fight the trafficking in human beings. 
The main task of the National unit on fight against illegal migration is to perform repressive measures regarding the fight against smuggling and organized illegal migration. 
In order to detect and decompose of the organized international criminal networks and smugglers network, the national unit cooperates with the partner countries operational police units abroad, mainly with the countries on the route of illegal migration 
V(d) More effective integration of migration and development policies 
Within the academic sphere, the studies on migration and integration of the foreigners were absent in 2010. 
There were not implemented any national projects regarding the preparation of the policy in the area of foreigners integration funded by the European Fund on integration in 2010, as well193. 
The EMN elaborated following studies in 2010 on: 
• Satisfying labour demand through migration in the SR 
• Temporary and circular migration in the SR

The Annual Policy Report 2011 provides an overview of the most important changes regarding legislative, institutional and practical aspects of migration and asylum that took place in the Slovak Republic in the reference period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011. 
The national annual policy report has been compiled within the framework of the European Migration Network activities by the EMN National Contact Point in the SR. 
The structure and the contents of the chapters follow the specification of the European Commission and are identical for all EU Member States. 
In 2011, no significant changes were made at the institutional level influencing migration and asylum policies. 
Migration and asylum issues did not form a significant part of political debates in 2011, but thanks to these two important events they were presented in the mass-media more widely and in a broader context compared to the previous years. 
The public debate on migration, integration and asylum was running mainly at the level of expert events organised by the non-governmental sector and international organisations in the framework of projects financed with EU funds. 
Accordingly, the number of persons held in police detention facilities for foreigners fell by 24%.

01. Introduction: Purpose and Methodology 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
Purpose and Methodology 
The Annual Policy Report 2011, which provides an overview of migration and asylum developments in the Slovak Republic, will serve as a background document to prepare the Annual Report of the European Commission on the Implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and, similarly as the previous report, it will form the basis for the Synthesis Annual Policy Report of the European Migration Network 2011 which will compare migration and asylum developments in the different European Union Member States. 
Just as in the previous years, the report provides information about the developments in policies and legislation and about the main political debates that had an impact on policy creation with regard to migration and asylum in 2011. 
The structure of the report allows for the provision of information about the developments in the Slovak Republic at the national level and also in the context of the EU developments. 
The report also contains an annex with a wellarranged summary of the progress in the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and of the Stockholm Programme. 
In addition to that, the report presents in each chapter basic statistical data, different from the data collected by Eurostat. 
The synthesis report prepared by the European Commission will provide an overall overview of statistics of all Member States that will help describe migration and asylum trends in 2011. 
1.1 Methodology 
The Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 has been prepared in line with the European Commission's specifications. 
Methodologically, the report is based on available expert literature, legislation, strategic documents of the SR, monitoring of available literature, research studies, internet sources, information published on the websites of relevant institutions and organisations, statistical information, and information known to the authors of the report from their own practice in migration and asylum. 
The data obtained from the MoI SR, specifically from the BBAP PFP, MO MoI SR, LERS MoI SR, FAD MoI SR, and from the MoLSAF SR, OLSAF, MoFA SR and IOM have represented an important source of information. 
The documents and brochures of other relevant state, international and non-governmental institutions and their websites have also formed a very important source of literature. 
Since the literature concerning migration and asylum in the SR is not extensive, the authors based this report not only on available literature, but also on the reports and studies published by the European Migration Network throughout the past years: 
Potočková, Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2009 Slovak Republic, European Migration Network, Bratislava, 2010

All the studies and reports mentioned above are available at www.emn.sk. 
Where the national legislation does not define certain terms, the terms pursuant to the 
01. Introduction: Purpose and Methodology 
In the report, the term alien is mainly used in the text and in some statistics prepared pursuant to national legislation. 
In these cases, the term corresponds to the definition under Art. 1, par. 2 of the Act on Stay of Aliens, and not to the term alien or foreigner according to the EMN Glossary. 
In 2011, the media and the expert public paid increased attention to migration issues in connection with the adoption of the new Act on Stay of Aliens and approval of the Migration Policy of the Slovak Republic with a Perspective until 2020; the press releases are therefore described in more detail in the next part of the report. 
However, none of these events received increased attention in the NC SR or among the political parties, nor they led to a broader debate at the political or parliamentary levels resulting in further significant changes in migration policy or legislation. 
General Structure of the Political and Legal System in the Slovak Republic 
2.1 General Structure of the Political System and Institutional Context 
The main actors in the field of migration and asylum in Slovakia were, just as in the years before, the following three ministries: 
The Ministry of Interior of the SR, through its Migration Office and the Bureau of the Border and Aliens Police of the PFP, is competent mainly in the field of legal and illegal migration, and asylum and integration of persons with granted asylum. 
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR4 is responsible for the area of labour migration and integration of foreigners. 
Similarly as in 2010, several organisational and personnel changes occurred at the MoLSAF SR in 2011 within the structures dealing with migration issues. 
5 Until 01 September 2011, the Ministry of Labour covered migration and foreigners' integration issues through two departments: the Department of International Relations, and the Department of Gender Equality and Equality of Opportunities. 
On 01 September 2011, the integration issues were shifted to a new department-Centre for Coordination of Foreigners' Integration (CCFI). 
CCFI fulfils the function of a coordination office for issues concerning foreigners' integration and migration. 
The migration issues have remained in the competence of

4 In the reference period, the position of the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family was held by Jozef Mihál. 
02. General Structure of the Political and Legal System in the Slovak Republic 
the Department of International Relations and Protocol, which was established on 01 August 2011 by merging the Department of International Relations and the Protocol Department. 
CCFI also coordinates the implementation of proposed integration measures arising from the Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the Slovak Republic. 
The next scope of activities of MoLSAF SR involves social care for unaccompanied minors, persons granted asylum and other categories of aliens; 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the SR6 is responsible, through its foreign missions abroad, for the issuance of visas and the receipt of applications for Slovak residence permits. 
The Ministry also assists in returning unaccompanied minors and in the preparation of readmission agreements. 
Compared to 2010, no significant changes were made in 2011 in the structure of the political system or institutional context in connection with migration and asylum, with the exception of the organisational change at the MoLSAF SR.

2.2 General Structure of the Legal System 
The general structure of the legal system in the field of migration and asylum is given by the hierarchy of the different sources of law in the SR. 
The other sources of national law having precedence over the laws of the SR pursuant to Article 7, par. 5 of the Constitution of the SR are international treaties on human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as international treaties the enforcement of which does not require a law, or international treaties which directly confer rights or impose duties on natural persons or legal entities and which were ratified and promulgated in the way laid down by a law. 
The structure of the legal system is further constituted by laws, decrees of the Government of the SR, generally binding legal regulations of ministries and other central state administration bodies, generally binding legal regulations of municipal councils, and decisions of the President of the SR. 
Considering the continental system of law exercised in the SR, court precedents in the form of decisions of general courts are not generally binding, and the decisions of the Constitution of the SR are only considered as sources of law in this respect. 
The most important legal regulations applying to migration and asylum are the following: 
This act merges and replaces the former acts mentioned above, and regulates the entry, stay and status of foreign nationals in the SR in a comprehensive manner. 
In addition to that, the act regulates the status of family members of EU nationals, extending the definition of this group of aliens by two new categories. 
The act introduces new types of temporary residence, extending in some cases the upper limits of the temporary residence period and of the extended period. 
It also extends aliens' obligations related to the filing of applications for temporary residence permit and their duties after taking over their residence documents. 
a permanent residence permit. 
Act No. 480/2002 Coll. on Asylum and on Changes and Amendments to Some Acts (hereinafter referred to as "Act on Asylum") regulates the international protection of aliens in the SR by defining the conditions and procedures related to asylum granting and provision of subsidiary protection and temporary shelter.

3.1 General Political Developments 
From the second half of 2010, the SR has been governed by a coalition of centre-right parties led by Prime Minister Iveta Radičová-the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union - Democratic Party (SDKÚ-DS), the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), Most-Hid, and the party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS). 
The most significant event in 2011 from the point of view of political developments was the voting on the European bail-out fund on 12 October 2011. 
Besides opposition parties (in the first round of the voting), the coalition party SaS also took a negative position, as a result of which the coalition lost its majority in the Parliament needed to approve the bail-out fund. 
After several unsuccessful negotiations, the Prime Minister merged the voting in the NC SR on the European bail-out with a vote of confidence. 
Since the SaS deputies did not join the voting, neither the bail-out fund nor the government obtained the necessary majority of votes, as a result of which the government lost confidence and fell. 
On the basis of further negotiations during the following days, 10 March 2012 was approved as the date of early parliamentary elections. 
On 25 October 2011, the President of the SR recalled the cabinet of Prime Minister Iveta Radičová, re-appointed it, and charged it with ruling until a new government is appointed on the basis of the results of the early parliamentary elections. 
The mandate of the caretaker government is restricted. 
The government is deprived of some constitutional functions, and some of its competences may only be exercised with President's consent. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
fundamental economic, social, national and foreign policy measures. 
As of 31 December 2011, the Government had 15 members: Prime Minister; 1st Deputy Prime Minister-who has also held the position of Minister of Transport, Construction and Regional Development-;two Deputy Prime Ministers who also hold the positions of Minister of Finance and Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, respectively; a Deputy Prime Minister27 without a portfolio (not appointed to run any ministry); and ten Ministers28. 
In the reference period, no changes occurred on the positions of Ministers relevant to migration and asylum issues. 
In 2011, no elections were held in the SR, except for the by-elections of mayors in 11 municipalities on 05 November 2011. 
The by-elections did not have a significant impact in terms of asylum and migration. 
Contrary to parliamentary or presidential elections, aliens could also vote in the municipal by-elections since citizenship of the SR is not a condition for voting in this type of elections. 
Persons (including aliens) with permanent residence in the SR are entitled to vote in municipal elections. 
In general, migration and asylum issues did not represent the principal topics of political debates in 2011, and did not have any impact on the changes that occurred within the structure of the political system in the reference period.

27 Deputy Prime Minister for Human Rights and Minorities, Rudolf Chmel. 
More details are available at http:// www.vlada.gov.sk/clenovia-vlady/ (consulted on 06/12/2011). 
The process of preparation and adoption of the MP did not raise a wider debate among politicians, but it evoked an important discussion among the expert public. 
The media informed about the MP and about migration issues in the SR more extensively compared to the years before, especially after it was approved by the Government.

Integration issues were rather discussed by the expert public and, more widely, after the criminal act of Anders Breivik in Norway who described Slovakia in his Manifesto as a country "least marked by multiculturalism"32 In this regard, the research conducted by SME Daily among the parliamentary political parties in the SR under the title Slovak Parties Don't Care about Foreigners should be mentioned here. 
33 According to this short research, most political parties do not consider dealing with multi-culturalism in the SR as a priority, or admit it as a topic for the future. 
None of the political parties deals with these issues in their political programmes; the only exceptions being Roma issues and relations with minority Hungarians. 
Most parties are not very open to immigrants, not even in connection with popu-

lation ageing discussed by demographers. 
They are reserved to the possibility of replacing the shrinking population with immigrants. 
According to the original schedule, the draft act was due to be approved and passed by the end of the first half of 2011. 
At the NC SR level, the draft did not raise a wider debate, either. 
Several comments by deputies of administrative nature were incorporated into the draft law. 
The comments also related to the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purpose of highly-qualified employment and changed conditions concerning the submission of some documents when applying for a temporary residence permit or for a visa. 
The media did not inform about the passing of the act or about the rules for foreigners under the act.

03. General Developments Relevant to Asylum and Migration 
3.3 Broader Developments in Asylum and Migration 
The two significant events in this area did not raise a wider response at a political level or among the general public. 
37 The media published several articles and broadcasted several TV programmes38 on trafficking in human beings in the second half of 2011 that coincided with the launch by MoI SR of a new campaign on new forms of human trafficking (forced labour) and with the promotion of the free helpline with EU financial support on the occasion of the European Day against Trafficking in Human Beings on 18 October 2011. 
The campaign, under the title You're Becoming a Slave without Information, has been run in the form of posters placed at bus and railway stations, in airport

The general institutional context is described in Chapter 2.1 of this Report. 
The only change in the field of migration was the organisational change within the MoLSAF SR, which established a new department dealing with integration issues-the Centre for the Coordination of Foreigners' Integration. 
It also identifies specific developments at the national level in connection with the implementation of the EU policies and legislation and the use of EU financial instruments. 
This part also summarises the main findings described in the annex on the implementation of the European Pact and Stockholm Programme. 
Economic Migration 4.1.1 Specific Context 
The SR has traditionally been rather a country of emigration than a country of immigration. 
42 Before 1989, foreigners came to the former Czechoslovakia from countries in the former Eastern bloc mainly for study reasons. 
On the basis of bilateral agreements on humanitarian aid in the form of expert preparation and on increasing of qualification through temporary employment, nationals of Vietnam, Angola, Cuba, Laos, Mongolia and North Korea came to Slovakia. 
Similar was the situation in the SR during the transformation period, when it was rather viewed as a country of origin or transit country44 for economic migrants than as a country of destination of labour migration.

45 Domonkos, T., Páleník M., Radvanský M., Satisfying Labour Demand Through Migration in the SR. 
Although the borders opened up, labour migration remained largely limited. 
Throughout the transition period, the living standards gradually rose, and with the accession to the EU and subsequently to the Schengen Area labour migration got facilitated and promoted. 
47 The SR has become a more attractive country from the point of view of labour migration, and even the country of destination for some foreigners. 
As far as labour migration is concerned, the number of foreigners since the founding of the SR until its accession to the EU represented approx. 5,000 persons, including nationals of the Czech Republic. 
After Slovakia's accession to the EU, the number of foreigners gradually increased from 3,431 persons in 2004 to more than the quadruple in 2008 (14,900 persons).

4.1.2 Developments within the National Perspective 
On 31 August 2011, the Government of the SR approved the Migration Policy, the contents and nature of which is based on the Migration Policy Concept of the Slovak Republic of 2005 and responds to the migration situation developments and needs of the Slovak Republic, especially in the field of economic migration. 
The objective of the MP is to promote the admission of economic migrants and employment of migrants in line with the needs of the national economy and the labour market with an emphasis on the admission of highly-qualified employees, scientists and, if required, other qualified migrants to cover jobs in short supply. 
According to the MP, the scope of admissions will be based on the analysis of the national economy and labour market needs. 
On the basis of these analyses and of the economic benefits of the different groups of economic migrants, it is considered to adopt, in the future, regulatory and control measures to ensure balance on the labour market and within the entire scope of economic migration, as well as the introduction of a scoring system and of job lists. 
The MP also focuses on those segments of economic migration which have not been dealt with yet in the SR or have been tackled only to a small extent. 
The MP highlights the need to use the potential of temporary and circular migration in the elimination of illegal migration, and the drain of highly-qualified and qualified labour force along with the current development of third countries. 
For these reasons, it is planned to update, in the future, the conditions creating the framework for migrants' entry to the labour market, seasonal work, temporary and circular migration, and various forms of short-term employment. 
In addition to that, the MP stresses the need to improve and make more efficient the collection and processing of labour market data through regular analysis and to set up regularly updated lists of jobs in short supply. 
Under the MP, all ministries must prepare their own action plans and specify in them their individual migration policy measures. 
The ministries' action plans will refer to a period of two years, and will be subsequently updated biannually. 
As far as the employment of foreigners is concerned, Slovakia did not introduce any restrictive measures in 2011 aimed to prevent access to the Slovak labour market or any other related measures to promote the return of migrants to their countries of origin. 
On the contrary, the SR set a direction in the MP towards mainly managed economic migration. 
Hence, the scope of labour immigration was not limited in 2011, and depended on the labour market needs. 
The Slovak Republic considers, in the framework of the Government's strategic material Minerva Slovakia into the First League, the introduction of a Slovak Card providing preferential conditions to highly qualified persons interested in working in Slovakia. 
In terms of legislation, the term Slovak Card is also mentioned in the new MP. 
With regard to the promotion of the admission of students or young professionals, besides the treaties concluded with New Zealand and Canada (more details in the Annex on the Pact I(b)), the SR developed other initiatives, as well. 
The amendments to these acts aim to prevent illegal migration and illegal work. 
Some areas of economic migration were also tackled through projects implemented by some NGOs and international organisations. 
The research project was conducted in 2010 and the publication focused on the economic, sociological and political factors of migration and analysed the impacts of the international trends in international migration on economic migration in Slovakia. 
The publication describes the actual situation of economic migrants in Slovakia and comments on it with regard to the current immigration and integration policies. 
In 2011, the Slovak Catholic Charity implemented the Bakhita project, supported by the European Fund for Integration of Third-Country Nationals in the framework of the Solidarity and Migration Flows Management programme. 
The project was divided into two parts. 
In the second part, foreigners with tolerated stay or with a permanent or 
4.1.3 Developments from the EU Perspective 
The SR supports legal migration for work purposes, while maintaining the condition that job vacancies are preferentially filled with registered job-seekers, job-seekers with Slovak citizenship, EU/EEA citizens and citizens of the Swiss Confederation, and only then by third-country nationals. 
04. Legal Immigration and Integration 
This act transposed into the national legislation the Council Directive 2009/50/EC of 25 May 2009 on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment. 
The relevant provisions of the directive have also been incorporated into the new Act on Stay of Aliens which entered into force on 01 January 2012 and transposed the Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions to the admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training, or voluntary services and Council Directive 2005/71/EC of 12 October 2005 on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research. 
More information is available in section I(b) of the Annex to this Report, which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
In 2011, the SR did not conclude any bilateral agreement on employment. 
These agreements are important with regard to the facilitation of the admission of students and young professionals. 
For more details refer to Annex I - section I(b). 
4.2 Family Reunification 
4.2.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
No new policies related to the migration of families were adopted in 2011. 
From the point of view of legislation, Act No. 120/2011 Coll. and Act No. 180/2011 Coll. entered into force; these acts, among others, amended the Act on Assistance in Material Need. 
For more details refer to section II(b) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
Pursuant to Art. 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, an individ- 
4.2.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
Changes in legislation were also made in Act No. 223/2011 Coll. which changed and amended Act No. 82/2005 Coll. on Illegal Work and Illegal Employment and on Changes and Amendments to Some Acts as Amended. 
The act introduced into the national legislation the EU Blue Card instrument, and facilitated the conditions of residence in the SR for the family members of Blue Card holders. 
The preferential status in favour of family reunification enables this category of persons, for instance, to do business and enter into employment relations or other work relations during their residence in the SR. 
This right has also been obtained by foreigners with temporary residence for the purpose of family reunification who are family members of holders of the next permanent residence permit granted on the basis of a five-year residence as a Blue Card holder within EEA and two-year residence as a Blue Card holder within the territory of the SR. 
57 For further information, refer to section I(b) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
57 Art. 23, par. 4 of Act No. 48/2002 Coll. on Stay of Aliens and on Changes and Amendments to Some Acts. 
The change in favour of third-country nationals with a temporary residence permit for the purpose of family reunification allows them to run a business right after the temporary residence permit has been granted, thus cancelling the 12-month period during which the alien did not dispose of this possibility. 
In order to harmonise Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification with the national legislation, the provisions regulating permanent residence have changed, too. 
A new element is the introduction of the possibility to grant a national visa to the family members of persons granted asylum and to aliens under subsidiary protection, provided that they do not represent a threat to state security or to public order. 
According to the new Act on Stay of Aliens, the extent of the foreigner's integration into the society is only considered when making a decision on the issuance of a permanent residence permit for a five-year period or for an unlimited period of time. 
For more details refer to section I(d) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and Stockholm Programme. 
4.3 Other Legal Migration 
The Migration Policy also states that it is necessary to provide information by means of immigration portals, (multilingual) websites, brochures and leaflets, and to raise general awareness among migrants by means of campaigns about illegal migration, smuggling, human trafficking, and also about the possible risks of work migration and assistance possibilities. 
In addition to that, the MP deals with labour force emigration, and stresses the need to prepare integration programmes for persons returning from abroad. 
In this respect, it aims to improve co-operation and raise awareness among relevant entities to allow them to fulfil their tasks in favour of emigrants' communities, and to launch an intensive discussion among experts and the public about the emigration of Slovak nationals. 
In the near future, the Migration Policy will be detailed in the form of concrete action plans. 
The other activities in this area aimed to raise awareness were based on the ones initiated in the previous year. 
Information about the possibilities of entry, legal residence, visas and about various integration measures can be found at the websites of MoLSAF SR, MoI SR and MoFA SR. 
Further information is provided through the EURES network. 
Yet, no public administration institution provides migrants with complex counselling. 
Services of this nature are only provided by the Migration and Information Centre60 established by IOM and co-financed with EIF funds and the state budget of MoI SR. 
Information or consultations about the different aspects of life in Slovakia can be obtained as follows: 
• In person, by phone or by e-mail 
Phase IV of the MIC IOM project was implemented in 2011 (approved on 01 November 2010). 
A total of 2,637 consultations were provided in the reference period. 
• Multilingual information brochures 
The brochures are distributed also to other relevant partners who come into contact with foreigners, such as the Aliens Police Department of PF, Slovak embassies abroad, consular offices of foreign countries in the SR, labour offices, and other state and non-state institutions, as well as to other persons interested in these issues within public events. 
• Website 
The website www.mic.iom.sk contains analytically collected legislative and practical information in three languages (Slovak, English, and Russian) about the main aspects of foreigners' life in Slovakia. 
As for the depth and extent of the contents, it is a unique information database used by foreigners and by relevant institutions and experts working with integration. 
According to Google Analytics statistics, the MIC website had a total of 89,242 absolute unique visitors from unique IP addresses in the period from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2011; the most viewed sections were those related to temporary residence, family reunification and the conditions to obtain citizenship. 
The website also offers for download all information brochures and information leaflets published so far. 
For further details refer to section I(f) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
4.3.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
With regard to the developments within the EU, the SR worked on updating the data published at the EU Immigration Portal in November 2011. 
This information concern the possibilities and conditions of legal immigration to the SR (e.g. information about current legislation, or the conditions to be met when an alien wishes to come to the SR for different reasons-for the purposes of study, work, business, etc.). 
04. Legal Immigration and Integration 
4.4.1 Specific Context 
MoLSAF SR has prepared an important strategic document-the Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the Slovak Republic (hereinafter referred to as the "Concept"). 
This document was adopted by the Government of the SR with Resolution No. 338 of 06 May 2009. 
Also, a summary report on the implementation of measures arising from the Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the SR has been prepared. 
Detailed information about the Concept is provided in the Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies in the SR 2009. 
MoLSAF SR is currently working on updating the Concept to bring it into compliance with the plans and objectives of the new Migration Policy. 
The specific measures of the MP related to integration are detailed in section I(g) of the Annex to this Report which deals with the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
In connection with integration, MoLSAF restored in 2011 the meetings with foreigners' communities, created a new platform Forum for Integration, and continued its involvement in the activities of the Inter-Ministerial Expert Commission for Work Migration and Foreigners' Integration (MEKOMIC). 
was organised by IOM61 in co-operation with the National Contact Point of the European Migration Network in the SR and with EIF support. 
The main objective of the conference was to ensure the mutual exchange of experiences and good practices among selected EU Member State on foreigners' integration, and to work out proposals and recommendations on foreigners' integration. 
The conference was preceded by a oneday workshop for experts who were trained by IOM in 2010 and 2011 with EIF support. 
The following projects were carried out, in particular: 
» Training and re-qualification courses MIC provides financial contributions to requalification and training courses meeting applicants' needs in connection with their integration into the society and finding a job (such as professional IT training, bookkeeping, language courses, etc.). 
Upon assessment of the clients' profiles, the 
The courses are held twice a week for beginners and twice a week for advanced participants. 
The low-threshold course is free of charge, and each meeting is a separate, closed, thematic block aimed to teach basic language knowledge in a given field. 
In the reference period from 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2011, counselling was provided to 477 individual clients during 933 consultations in total. 
about the different procedures and about the rights and obligations of foreigners in the different areas of their life in Slovakia. 
Depending on the topic and the interest of the target group, the leaflets are published in six languages: Slovak, English, Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese and Arabic; and are available in printed and electronic forms. 
and promotion of inter-cultural exchange 
In order to improve the organisation of the community life of foreigners and promote the inter-cultural exchange between these communities and the general population, MIC collaborates with a network of cultural mediators for the different communities of foreigners. 
The task of cultural mediators is to deliver to the community useful information about integration and act as mediators in communication between the migrants' communities and the general population. 
In total, MIC collaborates with 28 cultural mediators. 
» Training courses 
From 01 January 2011 to 31 December 2011, MIC prepared six training courses with regional coverage for all Slovak regions, with the participation of 126 relevant actors. 
The training courses focused on the building of inter-cultural and communication skills, provision of general information about migration with an emphasis on the positive aspects of migration, and exchange of experience in problematic areas. 
The training courses also contained an exchange of opinions on the proposals for improvement of co-operation between the institutions involved, about the possibilities of reducing the administrative burden and of creating an informal network of representatives of institutions to react more flexibly to problems they face and use the services of trained cultural mediators in their work with foreigners. 
One of the outcomes is final proposals to improve the approach to foreigners and make the cooperation between the different actors more effective. 
In order to promote the exchange of information within the informal network of the representatives of different institutions with cultural mediators, a webpage Platform for Dialogue has been created and placed under the website www.mic.iom.sk. 
• Television Programme to Support Foreigners' Integration - produced by the Local Media Institute. 
In the project framework, a several-day festival The Week of New Minorities (Fjúžn) was held in Bratislava. 
One of the aims of the festival was to develop relations between the communities and offer them room for their presentation. 
The festival was followed by independent cultural and social events. 
The main organiser of this activity was the Foundation of Milan Šimečka. 
• BAKHITA - free nursing courses were organised within the project for third-country nationals with permanent or temporary residence or tolerated stay in Slovakia. 
The project has been implemented by the Slovak Catholic Charity.

• Improvement of the possibilities of third-country nationals' integration at the local level - the project aims to draw the attention of the integration actors at the local level to migration and integration issues in the context of regional development. 
4.4.3 Developments from the EU Perspective 
All the projects mentioned in the previous chapter have been financed with European funds; hence, developments from the national perspective and the EU perspective overlap. 
4.5 Citizenship and Naturalisation 
In 2011, no developments were reported in this area. 
and Return 
5.1 Irregular Immigration 
5.1.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
Besides the new Act on Stay of Aliens, which entered into force on 01 January 2012 and has an impact on illegal migration (for more details refer to Chapter 5.1.2), illegal migration is also dealt by a special chapter of the Migration Policy. 
The Slovak Republic stresses in the MP that it efficiently fights against all forms of illegal migration, taking into consideration the human rights aspects connected with this phenomenon. 
The MP also emphasises the need to cooperate with EU countries, transit countries and the countries of origin of migrants; the implementation of legislative, organisational and administrative measures to prevent illegal migration in the field of control and sanctions in cases of illegal employment of migrants; the implementation of measures to increase the security of documents protection and the application of technical devices to detect the forging and falsification of documents; and performance of security checks of foreigners to verify invitations or grant residence permits. 
The policy aimed at the prevention of the risks of illegal migration is also implemented through the measures specified in the National Plan of Border Control Management of the SR for the Period 2011-2014.68 
From the point of view of the media, illegal migration issues represent the most reported area of migration. 
In 2011, the media informed about individual cases of illegal migrants captured nearby the external border; these persons were staying in the SR illegally and were either expelled or they applied for asylum. 
These sporadic reports did not raise wider public debate, nor had they an impact on changing the legislation or on the political debate in the parliament. 
The BBAP PFP also informs about these cases in 
68 Approved by Government Resolution No. 473 of 06 July 2011. 
5.1.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
On 20 July 2011, Act No. 223/2011 Coll. entered into effect. 
Hence, the Act on Stay of Aliens introduced a new reason for granting the tolerated stay in cases of illegal employment to a third-country national who was illegally employed under particularly exploitative work conditions or to an illegally employed minor, if their presence in the SR is inevitable for the purposes of criminal proceedings. 
In case this prohibition is violated, the sanctions include, besides fines, employer's exclusion from participating in public procurement and the obligation to make other specific payments. 
The responsibility for illegal employment ceases the moment the employer has fulfilled the new obligation to request from the third-country national a document authorising the third-country national to reside in the SR before admitting them to work, and to inform the local Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family about the start of employment within the set deadline, without having knowledge about the document being falsified. 
The control authorities are obliged to regularly identify the sectors with the highest risk of illegal employment and carry out controls mainly in these risk sectors. 
At the same time, the act introduced the obligation of the National Labour Inspectorate to provide the European Commission, on an annual basis, with information about performed checks and their outcomes. 
In addition to that, a list of illegal employers is published in the National Labour Inspectorate's website. 
The relevant provisions of the Directive are also transposed into the new Act on Stay of Aliens. 
The new Act on Stay of Aliens also transposes the Directive 2008/115/EC of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (Returns Directive), changing the definition and the reasons for administrative expulsion, as well as enforcement of the decision on administrative expulsion and the deferral thereof. 
The new act re-defines the categories of persons which can be expelled only if they represent a serious threat to state security or public order. 
70 The list is published at www.safework.gov.sk/register/ (consulted on 22/12/2011). 
accommodation and financial coverage of their stay. 
The reasons for detention have expanded to third-country nationals under administrative expulsion proceedings with the aim to ensure their departure if there is a risk that they would escape or try to avoid or prevent the process of preparation to enforce their administrative expulsion. 
For more details, refer to section II(a), (c) and (g) of the Annex to this Report monitoring the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
In 2011, the SR continued combatting illegal migration in co-operation with FRONTEX agency and with other EU countries, as well as with countries of origin and transit countries in the framework of international projects. 
5.2.1 Specific Context 
In the SR, the Voluntary Returns Programme was launched with the signing of the Agreement on Co-operation between the Ministry of Interior of the SR and the International Organisation for Migration on 20 August 1998 on assistance in the return of unsuccessful asylum seekers and illegal migrants to their country of origin. 
Forced return is applied where all other means have been exhausted to ensure respect by the migrant of the decision of the administrative authority or judicial authority and his/ her actual departure from the SR. 
An important tool for the regulation of migration in this field are readmission agreements at the EU level or bilateral agreements concluded with selected transit countries or countries of origin of migrants. 
In 2011, no readmission agreements at the bilateral level were concluded in 2011. 
5.2.3 Developments from the EU Perspective 
At present, voluntary returns from the SR to third countries are executed through the European Return Fund. 
The projects implemented by IOM include, besides returns and return assistance, individual pre-return counselling, granting of a return financial contribution, and post-return reintegration assistance to selected beneficiaries in the form of support to the implementation of approved business plan, assistance in job-seeking, material assistance, legal counselling, education support, assistance in seeking accommodation, and healthcare. 
At the same time, an information help-line and a website have been run, and a campaign was launched to raise the awareness in the target group about the possibility of return. 
In 2011, a total of 117 persons were registered in the voluntary returns programme and 95 returns were carried out. 
The total number of reintegration grants in 2011 is 26. 
Most of the grants were provided to returnees from Vietnam and Ukraine. 
5.3 Actions against Human Trafficking 
5.3.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
The programme aims to promote the development of mutual understanding and coordinate the work of all stakeholders in order to eliminate the risks of and prevent crimes of human trafficking, and to create conditions for the provision of assistance and support to victims of human trafficking, and ensure the protection of their human rights and dignity. 
Trafficking in human beings is also dealt by the Migration Policy which, in this area, operates based on the National Programme. 
Special attention is paid to child victims of trafficking. 
The Programme of Support and Protection of the Victims of Human Trafficking continued to run in 2011. 
Under this programme, upon returning to their countries of origin the victims of human trafficking are provided with reintegration assistance, including social, psychological and legal counselling, health assistance, work integration, ensuring safe accommodation, and financial contributions to cover their basic needs. 
Potential clients or external referring organisations that come into contact with 
A new campaign on combating human trafficking was launched in 2011, and a methodological film about these issues was produced71. 
For further details refer to section II(e) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
06. Border Control 
6.1 Control and Surveillance at External Borders 
6.1.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
As for the national perspective, a number of important events happened in the field of border control and protection. 
The National Plan is a planning document and its contents is based on the new Schengen acquis adopted after Slovakia's entry to the Schengen Area and on other strategic documents of EU institutions and bodies adopted in the given period. 
The structure of the new National Plan is adapted to the four-level model of control of IBM access in the SR in accordance with the updated Schengen EU Catalogue of Border Control, Return and Readmission72. 
The National Plan includes a Schedule of Tasks arising from the National Plan of Border Control Management for the Period 2011-2014. 
The newly adopted Migration Policy also contains a separate chapter on border control. 
This document, too, stresses that the SR ensures border control in compliance with the Schengen acquis. 
The MP mainly emphasises the introduction and development of technical facilities for border control, the use of modern technologies, promotion of co-operation with EU countries and within FRONTEX, and the training of competent staff. 
72 Document of EU Council No. 7864/09 SCH-EVAL 48 COMIX 252 
This act merged the former Act on Stay of Aliens and the Act on State Border Protection73. 
With regard to border issues, this law fully reflects Slovakia's membership in the Schengen Area and fully complies with the Schengen Border Code in terms of terminology. 
In 2011, the technology was partly replaced. 
For further details refer to section III(e) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
6.1.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
The SR continues developing intensive co-operation with FRONTEX agency and implementation of tasks under the pilot project of EUROSUR European Border Surveillance System. 
On 24 May 2011, the SR signed the Memorandum of Understanding EUROSUR. 
6.2 Cooperation with Respect to Border Control 
6.2.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
Besides the development summarised in Chapter 6.2.2, no specific development in relation to control and guard at the external borders occurred at the national level. 
6.2.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
In this regard, the SR concluded agreements on representation and appendices thereto with other EU Member States: Hungary, Austria, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Latvia. 
Agreements on representation with Poland, Lithuania, Germany and Spain are under preparation. 
With the launch of VIS on 11 October 2011, the SR started issuing visas with two biometric identifiers (photo and fingerprints) at the embassy in Cairo (North African region). 
Other embassies issue visas with only one biometric identifier - a photo. 
All Slovak embassies issuing visas are equipped with devices for fingerprint collection. 
The SR deployed a technology expert to the operation in North Africa, and selected police staff members were involved in the RABIT operation at the Greek-Turkish border. 
In addition to that, the SR was engaged in the METEOR and JUPITER operations. 
For further details refer to section III(d) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
07. International Protection, Including Asylum 
International Protection, Including Asylum 
7.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
Refugee migration in the SR is principally characterised by a continuing declining trend in the number of asylum applications compared to the previous period75. 
In 2011, asylum was requested by 491 persons, which is the smallest number since 1995. 
Compared to the previous year, the number of asylum seekers who were granted asylum was relatively stable-in 2011, asylum was granted to1 276 asylum seekers; in 2010, MO MoI SR granted asylum to 15 persons (for comparison, 14 asylums were granted in 2009). 
On the other hand, in 2011 MO MoI SR provided subsidiary protection to 91 persons, which is an increase by 34 cases compared to 2010. 
In 2011, the asylum granting procedure was suspended in 269 cases, and asylum was not granted in 186 cases, which is more than in 2010 when asylum was refused in 180 cases. 
Citizenship was granted in seven cases, which is an increase compared to 2010 when citizenship was granted to three persons. 
Just as in the case of other migration issues, asylum is also dealt with separately in the Migration Policy, with Slovakia declaring support to the adoption of a common EU asylum system. 
In the field of asylum policy, the SR complies with its traditional pillars and supports new forms of protection following the new challenges faced by the international community. 
The SR provides protection in the form of asylum and subsidiary protection, as well as temporary shelter. 
The SR supports EU activities related to the resettlement of third-country nationals through transfer on the basis of trilateral agreements between the Government, UNHCR and IOM. 
The data is available at http:// www.minv.sk/?statistiky-20 (consulted on 18/01/2012). 
76 The statistical data of MoI SR is available at http://www. minv.sk/?statistiky-20 (consulted on 18/01/2012). 
77 MO MoI SR, Annual Statistics, available at http://www.minv. sk/?statistiky-20 (consulted on 18/01/2012). 
From a practical view, the trilateral agreement between the Government of the SR, UNHCR and IOM on humanitarian transfer through Slovakia of refugees who need international protection was concluded on 22 December 2010. 
Under this agreement, partly co-financed by the European Refugee Fund, the SR would provide humanitarian aid to 100 refugees and persons under international protection for a period of six months after their entry to the SR in 2011 and 2012. 
In May 2011,46 Afghan women and children arrived in Slovakia and subsequently left the country and were permanently relocated in a third country. 
In December 2011, another group of 40 Somali refugees from Eritrea arrived in the SR and were provided with temporary shelter. 
The refugees were accommodated in the asylum facility of the MoI SR in Humenné in which they will stay, similarly as the previous groups, for a period of six months while they are gradually relocated to third countries. 
7.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
Slovakia plans to get actively involved, through MO MoI SR, in the continuation of the pilot project EUREMAII Relocation of Refugees from Malta within the EU, which will be financed by the European Refugee Fund. 
The SR aims to relocate through the project ten persons who were granted international protection in Malta, the target group being families with children and single parents with children. 
The grant application was submitted in October 2011. 
At present, the project selection and approval process is in place. 
this office involve coordination and support of practical co-operation among EU Member States and of a common training system, to create the platform for information about countries of origin, create asylum support teams, and carry out activities to promote solidarity. 
The SR appointed its representatives to asylum support teams and was actively engaged in these teams through its representative from MO MoI SR within a project to support Greece in the setting up of a system for the admission of asylum seekers to asylum facilities. 
In 2011, the SR participated in the final conference on the joint UNHCR, IOM and ICMC project Promotion of Resettlement in the EU through Practical Co-operation by EU Member States and Other Stakeholders which was joined by Slovakia in 2010. 
The main objective of the project was to promote wider involvement of EU Member States in resettlement activities by promoting co-operation between EU Member States through the support of several stakeholders and a coordinated practical approach; the support of practical and logistical co-operation between the EU Member States which implement resettlement programmes, inter-connecting the different phases of the resettlement process (pre-flight health inspections, cultural and orientation programmes, transport as such, etc.); the support and promotion of admission services and capacities; and the formulation of recommendations for the initial phase of the integration of resettled persons into the society. 
08. Unaccompanied Minors (and Other Vulnerable Groups) 
Unaccompanied Minors and Other Vulnerable Groups 
8.1 Developments within the National Perspective 
In 2011, no specific significant development in relation to unaccompanied minors or other vulnerable groups occurred in the SR. 
8.2 Developments from the EU Perspective 
As for the impacts and developments from the EU perspective, no significant development in relation to unaccompanied minors occurred in the SR in 2011. 
In 2011, the SR joined two regional projects concerning unaccompanied minors: Best practice and coordination of the access to care for unaccompanied minors and former unaccompanied minors seeking asylum and Improvement of the quality of nursing and care for unaccompanied minors-asylum seekers in Central European countries. 
For further details refer to section 5(a) of the Annex to this Report which monitors the implementation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme. 
Global Approach To Migration 
This conceptual and strategic document represents the basis for all planning and programming documents on official development aid for the next five years. 
This strategy reflects the development of foreign policy interests of the SR, the changes achieved by Slovakia as a new donor since 2003-including completion of the development aid system-, experience obtained in the provision of development aid, and Slovakia's commitments arising from its membership in the EU. 
9.2 Developments within the National Perspective 
As with other sub-chapters, the Migration Policy deals with migration and development issues in a separate chapter. 
The SR declares in this document the importance of a systemic approach and elaboration on this phenomenon according to the current migration situation. 
The Migration Policy stresses the need for a systemic promotion of coherence between migration and development policies, and a deeper incorporation of migration issues into the development policy in relation to priority countries. 
It also emphasises the need for a targeted orientation of development aid on the priority countries for Slovak development aid and, in justified cases, to other countries relevant from the point of view of migration flows to the SR/ EU, and the need to regularly conduct analyses for this purpose.

9.3 Developments from the EU Perspective 
In 2011, the SR carried out specific projects of official development aid with an explicit migration element: 
• A House Midway (Bosnia and Herzegovina) 
• Activities for Libyan children (Tunisia) 
• Equal opportunities and subsistence for Bosnians, Serbians and Croatians affected by explosions of landmines - Fruit, Not Mines 
With regard to development co-operation, the Government of the SR approved on 02 November 2011 the draft Agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Republic of Kenya on Development Co-operation.

Directive 2009/50/EC was originally planned to be transposed into the new Act on Stay of Aliens prepared by the MoI SR. 
Directive 2009/50/EC was fully transposed through Act No. 223/2011 Coll. with effect from 20 July 2011.86 
Annex to National Annual Policy Report 2011 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
The commitments in the Pact relevant to this sub-section are the following: 
I(a) Implement policies for labour migration 
In the Slovak Republic, legal immigration from third countries has not been regulated yet by setting quotas for certain groups of economic migrants from third countries or by publishing a list of jobs. 
From the point of view of legislation, Act No. 223/2011 Coll. which entered into force on 20 July 2011 should be mentioned here. 
This act amended Act No. 5/2004 Coll. on Employment Services and on Changes and Amendments to Some Acts by extending the obligations of employers related to the employment of the nationals of EU Member States and third-country nationals. 
These obligations are incorporated in the new provision of Art. 23a and include the employer's obligation to request from a third-country national, prior to employing them, a valid residence document or any other residence permit under a special regulation or to keep a copy of such document throughout such employment. 
In spite of the economic growth at an expected rate of 3.6 per cent in 201 188, the employment sector continues to face big problems. 
The economic growth has mostly been achieved through labour productivity whose growth has, unfortunately, slowed down. 
89 In 2011, there has been a very slight year-to-year increase in the number of migrants employed in the SR through employment permits. 
Another condition is to have a labour contract or an employer's written promise to employ the alien for a minimum period of one year. 
The agreed salary must be a minimum 1.5 times the average wage in the national economy91 of the SR in the given sec- 
90 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
91 On the other hand, the new Act on Stay of Aliens which will enter into force on 01 January 2012 stipulates in Art. 38, par. 13 that 
Annex to National Annual Policy Report 2011 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
tor. 
The Blue Card is granted for a maximum period of three years and can be repeatedly extended. 
The Blue Card issued in the SR expires when the alien obtains a Blue Card in another EU Member State. 
The Blue Card facilitates the entry of highly qualified labour force to the labour market and simplifies the conditions of residence for the family members of Blue Card holders. 
The application for temporary residence can also be filed on behalf of such alien by a Blue Card holder with whom that alien requests family reunification. 
On the basis of an application filed by a third-country national, COLSAF issues confirmations about the possibility to fill up a job vacancy corresponding to highly qualified employment to be attached to the application for the Blue Card. 
As of 31 December 2011, five applications for such confirmation were filed at the COLSAF; one application was refused, confirmations were issued in the case of two applications (Ukraine nationals applying for positions as physician and informatics expert, respectively), and two applications are being processed at the moment (two Ukraine nationals applying for positions as physicians). 
the condition concerning the monthly salary amount in the case of selected highly qualified jobs is met if the agreed monthly salary corresponds to a minimum 1.2 times the average monthly salary of an employee in the Slovak economy in the given sector, as published by the Statistical Office of the SR. 
•ft 
What is essential in this process is the creation of an attractive environment for foreigners who are needed for the development of the economy. 
In 2011, the MoESRS SR amended Act No. 172/2005 Coll. on the Organisation of State Support of Research and Development and on Amending Act No. 575/2001 Coll. on the Organisation of Government Activities and on the Organisation of the Central State Administration, as Amended, by newly defining in Art. 26b the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of research and development, including conditions and requirements for an agreement on hosting an alien who is not a national of an EU Member State, as well as the conditions and responsibilities of the admitting organisations, and the conditions for issuing a permit for the admitting organisation to conclude hosting agreements. 
According to this document, such migrants include, for example, students, teachers, scientists, researchers, businessmen having or planning to establish innovating companies and companies focusing on the transfer of applied research results to practice, etc.95 A legal definition of the term Slovak Card is also mentioned in the document adopted by the Government of the SR - Migration Policy of the Slovak Republic with a Perspective until 2020. 
Since study and work should only become the secondary purpose of their stay, the duration of courses or employment with one employer may not exceed a period of six months, and the requirement to obtain an employment permit shall not apply. 
With the aim to execute this agreement, the SR shall issue a national visa valid for a maximum period of 12 months to an applicant meeting the set requirements, and the number 
92 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
of visas issued in one calendar year is limited to 100.97 
The target group is university students and graduates, students of educational institutions and citizens interested in occasional employment or further special preparation on the basis of a labour contract agreed in advance, provided that the requirements stipulated in the agreement have been met. 
For the purpose of implementing this agreement, the SR shall issue to an applicant meeting the set criteria a national visa valid for a maximum period of 12 months; such applicant may work in the entire territory of the SR throughout the validity of such visa irrespective of the labour market situation and without a work permit. 
The MP SR points out the need to exploit the potential of temporary and circular migration in the elimination of illegal migration and outflow of highly qualified and qualified labour forces along with a development of third countries. 
The Slovak labour market is negatively influenced by the brain drain from the SR to abroad, especially to other EU Member States and OECD countries.

1(b) Improving skills recognition and labour matching 
As far as the labour market is concerned, the recognition of education depends on the assessment by the employer, as well as on the assessment by the competent Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, which assesses the completed education together with the application for employment permit with an enclosed document on education, officially translated into Slovak. 
For this reason, the activities of the Centre for the Recognition of Documents on Education of MoESRS SR are planned to be promoted. 
Moreover, the MP explicitly states that it is necessary to simplify the mechanism concerning the recognition of special qualifications for the purposes of employment and for academic purposes for persons with granted asylum, aliens under subsidiary protection and displaced persons. 
The labour market needs are assessed by the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family. 
103 The current MP, however, highlights the need to improve and make more efficient the collection and processing of labour market data and the creation and regular update of lists of jobs with a lack of labour forces.

The number of third-country nationals employed in the SR by 31 December 2011 (permits - 3,253 + ICNONEU - 1,905) was 5,158.105 
A foreigner can be registered as seeking employment, if she/he was granted a permanent residence permit. 
Legislation in some of the EU Member States allows foreigners to stay in their territory for a certain period of time also after their employment is terminated and to register as jobseekers and seek a job. 
2.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
The following commitments of the Pact are relevant to this sub-section: 
1(d) To regulate family migration more effectively 
No new policies with respect to family migration were adopted in 2011. 
This act regulates family immigration more effectively. 
108 The first category includes a partner with whom a Union citizen has a durable, duly attested relationship. 
This type of temporary residence will be granted to precisely defined family members of a third-country national with temporary or permanent residence in the territory of the SR, precisely defined family members of a person with granted asylum under 18 years of age, or to a third-country national who is a dependent person under an international treaty. 
108 Art. 2 par. 5 letters g) and h). 
In order to harmonise Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification with the national legislation, the provisions governing permanent residence have also been modified. 
The new act reduces the minimum requested duration of residence from five to four years on the basis of which a holder of the permanent residence permit may apply for permanent residence for an unlimited period of time. 
Another piece of news is introduction of the possibility to grant a national visa to family members of persons with granted asylum and aliens under subsidiary protection, provided that they do not endanger state security or public order. 
This category of persons has a legal entitlement to be granted a national visa and constitutes an exception from the possibility of appeal against the non-granting or cancellation of the visa which normally applies to other aliens. 
The need to grant a national visa to this category of persons arose in connection with their special status and the endeavours of the SR to ensure family unity of the person with granted asylum or of the person under subsidiary protection. 
The extent of integration into society is not given by a requirement for language knowledge, level of education or work experience. 
In making a decision on granting these types of permanent residence and temporary residence permits, the police department takes into account the duration of the applicant's current residence in the SR, which could be viewed as taking into account the extent of foreigner's integration into the society. 
2.2 Stockholm Programme 
The condition 
That means that an alien whose income does not reach the legal minimum amount may apply for state assistance in the form of material need benefits irrespective of their type of resistance in the SR, whereas the receipt of benefits is not tied to previous payment of social insurance. 
The changed legislation introduced the obligation of the local Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family to set the way of providing benefits in material need and supplementary benefit in material need, and the obligation of municipalities to set the way to provide one-off benefits in material need. 
At the same time, this act has extended the category of persons who find themselves in material need and are entitled to receive the activation benefit serving for obtaining, maintaining or improving their knowledge, special skills or work habits for the purpose of finding a job. 
3. Other Legal Migration 
The following commitments of the Pact are relevant to this sub-section: 
I(e) to strengthen mutual information on migration by improving existing instruments where necessary 
The exchange of information on illegal migration between the EU Member States in 2011 was ensured mainly by attending regular meetings of the FRONTEX Risk Analysis Network's FRAN. 
States must fill in these documents according to a set plan into a specific ICONET folder within the set deadline. 
Information is provided on a daily and monthly basis and concerns illegal state border crossings, readmissions and smuggling. 
As for foreigners' integration, information is exchanged through meetings of the National Contact Points for Integration (NCPI) in Brussels in which the SR keeps a representative. 
The exchange of information on the best asylum procedures is promoted through the ENARO network (European Network of Asylum Reception Organisations) into which the MO Mol SR was admitted in 2009 and has been successfully involved in exchanges of expert staff who ensure reception of asylum seekers in asylum facilities. 
The topic of the year 2011 was accommodation. 
In May 2011, one employee from the Swiss Federal Migration Office was received in the asylum facility in Humenné under the exchange programme of the ENARO network. 
In June 2011, a representative of the MO MoI SR participated in a seminar in the Netherlands, which primarily dealt with accommodation under the ENARO network - Reception Expert Teams (RET). 
In general, information on migration and asylum is exchanged through the European Migration Network and through cooperation among its National Contact Points. 
I(f)) Improve information on the possibilities and conditions of legal migration 
MoLSAF SR has re-worked its website, with Migration Policy and Integration Policy directly appearing on the home page of www.employment.gov.sk to ensure a direct and simplest possible access to documents concerning the respective areas. 
The Migration Policy section will contain EU and SR documents related to the scope of activities of MoLSAF SR in the field of migration policy, including information on the procedure and conditions of foreigners' employment in the SR in Slovak, partly in English language. 
For further details see section I(h). 
The European Migration Portal will be interconnected with the national websites of the competent central state administration authorities, thus offering the possibility to obtain more detailed information or request information. 
This information will be available at the above-mentioned websites. 
In 2011, the EURES Desk of COLSAF organised one-day work seminars at selected local labour offices in Nitra (32 participants), Michalovce (30 participants) and Zvolen (29 participants) under the title EURES Opens Its Doors to Migrants. 
The seminars were held with the aim to promote the integration of foreigners living in Slovakia. 
The objective of the seminar was to help eliminating the barriers to foreigners' migration and raise awareness through institutions providing foreigners with assistance, thus creating the conditions for a better access to public services in the territory of Slovakia. 
The work seminars were run in the form of presentations by invited institutions and representatives of migrant communities in Slovakia. 
They would therefore welcome if more language training centres provided Slovak language courses. 
They also spoke about the difficulties related to the recognition of education documents, in seeking jobs for their partners, and excessive formalities. 
The invited representatives of migrant communities expressed their satisfaction with the given activity and appreciated the information provided by the participating institutions. 
No public administration institution has provided migrants with complex counselling. 
113 This type of services is only provided by the Migration and Information Centre established by the IOM and cofinanced from the EIF funds and from the state budget of the Ministry of Interior of the SR. 
Required information and advice concerning the different aspects of life in Slovakia can be obtained in person, by phone, by e-mail communication or at the website www.mic.iom.sk.sk which is regularly updated. 
EIF projects also covered information activities, focusing on providing information about migration and foreigners' integration, such as the project TV Programme to Support Foreigners' Integration, carried out by the Local Media Institute. 
One of the measures in the new MP SR adopted in 2011, to be further specified in the action plans of the different ministries, is the creation of information and consultation centres for migrants to improve their access to information about entry and residence, and about living and working condi- 
3.2 Stockholm Programme 
The relevant commitments in the Stockholm Programme are similar to those in the Pact, and therefore do not require further information. 
In 2011, MoLSAF SR created a new organisational unit - Centre for the Coordination of Foreigners' Integration (CCFI). 
CCFI serves as a coordination unit for issues concerning foreigners' integration and migration, and is involved in the creation of the state policy and conceptual work related to migration and foreigners' integration. 
Migration issues remained also in the competence of the Department of Foreign Relations and Protocol which was created on 01 August 2011 by merging the Department of International Relations and the Protocol Department. 
They are jointly involved in the preparation of the state policy and conceptual work in the field of migration and foreigners' integration, and in the creation of legislative measures, other generally binding legal regulations, long-term development programmes, strategic plans and their enforcement at the inter-ministerial level. 
117 Annex No. 2 of 02 August 2011 to the Organisation Chart of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic No. 30/2011 of 24 June 2011. 
The agenda of the meetings included presentation of the new department - Centre for Foreigners' Integration of MoLSAF SR, discussion on the Concept of Foreigners' Integration and on the amendment to the Act on Employment and foreigners' access to the labour market, and on general renewal of cooperation. 
Besides the representatives of communities, the meeting was also attended by non-governmental and international organisations working in the field of migration and by representatives of relevant universities. 
MoLSAF SR created a completely new work platform for experts at state and non-state levels working in the field of foreigners' integration in Slovakia - the Forum for Integration (the first meeting was held in October 2011). 
MoLSAF SR coordinates the preparation works on the updated Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the SR, which was adopted in May 2009. 
MoLSAF SR created seven working groups for key topics (healthcare, accommodation, education, inclusion, employment, self-government, and partners) with the aim to make the document more effective and to make it comply with the plans and objectives of the new MP. 
The new MP SR mentions the following planned measures in the section related to integration: 
• Implementation of so-called integration mainstreaming in the preparation and creation of legislation; 
• Increased emphasis on human rights and tolerance, fight against discrimination and intolerance by elaborating a coordinated communication strategy including activities focused on public awareness-raising, systemic cooperation with public media and initiation of wider discussions; 
• Setting of a mechanism for systemic monitoring of the fulfilment of migrants' integration indicators; 
• Creation of conditions for the implementation of integration policy at the regional and local levels through relevant entities, especially through higher territorial units, towns and municipalities, and definition of the possibilities of cooperation with regard to their competences and responsibilities; 
• Involvement of the members of different migrant associations and communities in the integration process at the local and regional levels; 
• Provision of information to migrants in the countries of origin prior to their arrival; 
• Simplification of the mechanism of recognition of expert qualifications; 
• Ensuring available Slovak language training and socio-cultural orientation for migrants; 
• Considering a change in the naturalisation procedure and the acquisition of Slovak Republic citizenship in order to speed up the integration process, and facilitate and make more transparent the processes geared towards the granting of permanent residence permit and, subsequently, the acquisition of the Slovak citizenship, etc.121

121 Migration Policy of the Slovak Republic with a Perspective until 2020. 
The measures currently in place are aimed at the integration of third-country nationals (e.g. measures allowing migrants to obtain basic knowledge of the hosting country's language, training programmes, measures at the local level) and are mainly implemented by international and non-governmental organisations under projects financed from funds of the general programme Solidarity and Migration Flows Management and co-financed from the budget of the MoI SR. 
Specifically, the following projects have been implemented: 
• Migration Information Centre to Support Foreigners in Slovakia (Stage IV) (www.mic.iom.sk) - for more details see I(f). 
In 2011, the IOM Migration Information Centre organised low-threshold language courses of Slovak for third-country nationals. 
• TV Programme to Support Foreigners' Integration (www.integruj.sk) - for more details refer to I(f). 
The Times of New Minorities (http://www.nadaciamilanasimecku.sk and www.multikulti.sk) - the project activities focus on awareness raising among the Slovak public about the life, culture and traditions of new minorities living in Slovakia and their status in the society. 
A several-day festival entitled The Week of New Minorities (Fjúžn) was organised in Bratislava in the framework of the project. 
Among other things, the festival aimed to develop the relations among communities and provide them with room for presentation. 
The festival was followed by individual cultural and social events. 
• BAKHITA (http://www.charita.sk/stranky/o-projekte-2) - under the Bakhita project, free courses of care were organised for third-country nationals with temporary or permanent residence or tolerated stay in Slovakia. 
• Improving the possibilities of third-country nationals' integration at the local level (http://www.cvek. sk/main.php? 
p=projekty&lang=sk) - the project aims at drawing the attention of actors working with migrants' integration at the local level to the migration and integration issues in the context of regional development. 
In order to achieve this objective, varied information about integration at the local level has been collected (statistical data, information about legislation and public policies, interesting examples of integration at the local level from abroad, etc.) and subsequently provided to these (by means of bulletins and a website).125 
I(h) Promote information exchange on best practices in terms of reception and integration 
A national website on integration is under preparation, and it is planned to intensify the exchange of information between institutions and other stakeholders engaged in migrants' integration. 
Upon implementation of integration measures, MoLSAF SR managed, for the first time, to place a link to important information about other ministries, stays, citizenship and employment within one section of the updated MoLSAF SR website. 
Anybody interested can find this information in Slovak and English languages at the main webpage of MoLSAF SR under the heading Foreigners' Integration in Slovakia. 
In the framework of its awareness raising activities, MoLSAF SR presents its own achievements through regular press releases on the main page of MoLSAF SR. 
Under the auspices of the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR, the international conference National Dialogue on Integration was organised by the IOM International Organization for Migration127 in cooperation with the National Contact Point of the European Migration Network in the SR and with EIF support on 15 November 2011 in Bratislava. 
The main objective of the conference was to create a room for mutual exchange of experiences and good practices on foreigners' integration among selected European Union Member States and prepare proposals and recommendations on foreigners' integration. 
Examples of good practice were presented by experts specialised in this area and working in state institutions or non-governmental organisations in the Czech Republic, Portugal and Austria. 
Over 130 participants from public administration institutions, including territorial self-governments, as well as from international organisations, nongovernmental organisations and migrant associations running activities in Slovakia attended the conference. 
The conference National Dialogue on Integration was preceded by a one-day workshop for experts who attended training courses organised by the IOM International Organization for Migration in 2010 and 2011 with the support of the European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals. 
At the conference, IOM International Organization for Migration presented recommendations prepared by the workshop participants to improve the process of foreigners' integration in the SR. 
The recommendations formed the basis for a panel discussion, which involved the representatives of the MO MoI SR, MoLSAF SR, BBAP PFP, and the Institute for Public Affairs, as well as a culture mediator as a representative of migrant communities. 
4.2 Stockholm Programme 
The following commitments of the Stockholm Programme are relevant to this sub-section: 
3(b) to incorporate integration issues in a comprehensive way in all relevant policy areas 
The integration policy is implemented in the SR in compliance with the Concept of Foreigners' Integration of the SR under the sponsorship of MoLSAF SR. 
The integration issues are gradually incorporated into other areas of national policies. 
Chapter 2 Integration contains a summary of the fundamental objectives of the integration policy in the SR and follows the Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the field of integration mainstreaming. 
All state policies (sectoral policies, legal regulations and measures) under preparation should take into consideration the impact on foreigners' integration in the SR. 
Under the MP, all ministries must prepare their own action plans. 
127 Under the project Migration Information Centre to Support Foreigners in Slovakia (Stage IV) 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2011 - Slovak Republic 
MoLSAF SR prepared guidelines for the local Offices of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR, thanks to which improper decisions related to state social benefits have been eliminated. 
3(e) improved consultation with and involvement of civil society 
As stated in sub-section I(g), MoLSAF SR renewed the important meetings with foreigners' communities living in Slovakia. 
In addition to that, MoLSAF SR created a completely new work platform for experts at state and non-state levels working in the area of foreigners' integration in Slovakia - the Forum for Integration. 
As mentioned in sub-section I(h), MoLSAF SR presents its own achievements in the field of migrants' integration at the main webpage of MoLSAF SR by means of regular press releases addressed to the general public. 
MoLSAF SR sponsored the international conference National Dialogue on Integration, the objective of which was to create a room for mutual exchange of experiences and good practices in foreigners' integration among selected European Union Member States and prepare proposals and recommendations in the field of foreigners' integration suggested by the workshop participants. 
3(f) to enhance democratic values and social cohesion in relation to immigration and integration of immigrants and to promote intercultural dialogue and contacts 
The current measures focus on the promotion of democratic values and social cohesion in relation to immigration and integration of immigrants, and on the promotion of the inter-cultural dialogue and contacts by, especially, international and non-governmental organisations under projects financed from the general programme Solidarity and Migration Flows Management and co-financed from the budget of the MoI SR. 
For more details see I(g). 
As sub-section I(h) suggests, MoLSAF SR sponsored the international conference National Dialogue on Integration with the objective to create a room for mutual exchange of experiences and good practices in foreigners' integration among selected European Union Member States and prepare proposals and recommendations on foreigners' integration aimed at the improvement of the foreigners' integration process in the Slovak Republic, as formulated by the workshop participants. 
The conference was attended by over 130 representatives of public administration institutions, including territorial self-governments, as well as international organisations, non-governmental organisations and migrant associations running activities in Slovakia. 
MOLSAF SR attended the meeting on the results of the comparative research MIPEX III, organised by the British Council within the Week of New Minorities. 
At the meeting, the representatives of MoLSAF SR presented the outcomes of MIPEX III from the point of view of MoLSAF SR and provided an interview to the media on foreigners' integration issues.

The discussion was also attended by migrants living in the SR, experts, and the general public. 
MoLSAF SR provided information about the planned update of the Concept of Foreigners' Integration in the SR. 
For the first time ever, MoLSAF SR organised, under the auspices of the Deputy Minister, the collection of items for spare-time and sports activities in reception and accommodation centres in the Slovak Republic. 
After the collection was finished on 13 October 2011, the collected items were handed over to the respective centres. 
Throughout 2011, representatives of the academia, independent experts, non-governmental organisations, the Association of the Towns and Municipalities of Slovakia and the ministries were invited to and consulted on the preparation of the documents: Conceptual Plans of the Migration Policy of the SR for the Period 2011-2015 and Migration Policy of the SR with a Perspective until 2020 aimed at setting priorities within the scope of their work. 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND RETURN 5. 
Illegal Immigration 
11(a) only case-by-case regularisation 
At present, the SR neither has any regularisation programme for illegal migrants, nor is it considering introduction of any such programme. 
What can be considered as a certain regularisation element in connection with illegal migration is the tolerated state instrument, which serves for temporary legalisation of a third-country national's residence, but is not a systemic regularisation scheme. 
The Act on Stay of Aliens thus introduced a new reason for granting tolerated stay, in cases of illegal employment to a thirdcountry national who has been illegally employed under particularly exploitative working conditions or to an illegally employed minor if its presence in the territory of the SR is inevitable for the purposes 
130 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
131 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
Annex to National Annual Policy Report 2011 
The relevant provisions of the Directive have also been transposed into the new Act on Stay of Aliens. 
In addition, the new Act on Stay of Aliens effective from 01 January 2012 makes tolerated stay accessible to a new category of aliens, while respecting their private and family life, and for the purpose of promoting the support of victims of human trafficking. 
II(c) ensure that risks of irregular migration are prevented 
The imposition of the entry ban will not form an automatic part of the decision on administrative expulsion, but only an option for the police department, changing the duration of the entry ban depending on the reasons for administrative expulsion. 
The previous decisions on administrative expulsion or entry to the territory of the SR throughout the prohibition of entry will be considered separately and will represent a reason for imposing the entry ban to the whole EU territory. 
The new act redefines the categories of persons who can only be expelled if they seriously threaten state security or public order. 
An important piece of news is the introduction of an alternative to detention by imposing the obligation onto a third-country national to regularly report his/her stay or to make a warranty deposit; this is only possible if a third-country national proves accommodation and financial coverage of his/ her stay. 
These alternatives to detention are excluded in case administrative expulsion proceedings are conducted against a third-country national who represents a serious threat to state security or public order, or threatens state security, public order or public health. 
The reasons for detention are extended to cases of third-country nationals subject to administrative expulsion proceedings aimed at ensuring their departure, if there is a risk of escape or if they avoid or hinder the process of preparation of their administrative expulsion. 
In case the police department fails to issue, in such case, a decision on administrative expulsion within 48 hours, it must immediately release the alien. 
II(d) to develop cooperation between Member States, using, on a voluntary basis and where necessary, common arrangements to ensure the expulsion of illegal immigrants 
Biometric data of expelled aliens is not exchanged between the SR and other Member States at present. 
132 National Plan of Border Control Management of the Slovak Republic for the Period 2011-2014, available at http://www.rokovania. sk/Rokovanie.aspx/BodRokovaniaDetail?idMaterial=19962 (consulted on 18/11/2011). 
data available to other Member States. 
II(g) take rigorous actions and penalties against those who exploit illegal immigrants 
Directive 2009/52/EC of 18 June 2009 providing for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals was transposed to the Slovak legislation through Act No. 223/2011 Coll. which changed and amended Act No. 82/2005 Coll. on Illegal Work and Illegal Employment and on changes and amendments of some acts, as amended. 
In the event of violation of this prohibition, the applicable sanctions include, besides fines, exclusion of the employer from the possibility to participate in public procurements, as well as other specifically listed payments, such as payment of due salary, payments corresponding to the income tax amount, social insurance and health insurance payments, payment of the costs of due wage delivery and of the costs related to administrative expulsion. 
In spite of the fact that the responsibility for sanctions is primarily borne by the illegal employer, the amendment act introduces the possibility of shift of responsibility to other specific persons involved in the given supply of work, goods and services. 
The employer bears no responsibility for illegal employment, if it has fulfilled the newly introduced obligations by requesting a document entitling the third-country national to reside in the SR prior to taking him/her up to job and informed the local Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family about the start of employment within the set deadline, but had no knowledge of the document being falsified. 
The financial sanction that can be imposed onto an employer in the event of breach of the prohibition of illegal employment may attain an amount from EUR 2,000 up to EUR 200,000. 
The fine for illegal work may reach EUR 331. 
A new criterion in setting the amount of fine for breaching the prohibition of illegal employment is the number of illegally employed natural persons. 
The control authorities are obliged to regularly identify the sectors in which the risk of illegal employment is the highest and conduct control in these risk sectors in particular. 
The amendment act also set the obligation of the National Labour Inspectorate to provide the European Commission with annual information about the conducted controls and their outcomes. 
In addition to that, the amendment act defined the employers' obligations related to the employment of third-country nationals; in the event that any of the obligations under the Act on Employment Services is violated, the employer may be imposed a fine of up to EUR 33,193.91. 
Upon meeting specific requirements, illegally employed persons may obtain tolerated stay in the SR under the amendment act. 
In 2011, the National Unit to Combat Illegal Migration of the BBAP PFP revealed seven cases of smuggling. 
Annex to National Annual Policy Report 2011 
By means of these criminal acts, these individuals gained illegal profits for a total amount of EUR 1,420,294,87. 
II(h) an Expulsion Decision taken by one Member State (MS) should be applicable throughout the EU and entered into the SIS obliging other MSs to prevent the person concerned from entering or residing 
With regard to illegal migration, since Slovakia's accession to the Schengen Area cooperation between the EU Member States related to expulsions is governed by Directive 2001/40/EC on the mutual recognition of decisions on the expulsion of third country nationals. 
Only a few cases of executing a decision on expulsion issued by another EU Member State under this directive have occurred since its transposition into the national legislation in 2007134. 
The Slovak Republic recognises decisions on return issued by other EU Member States pursuant to Directive 2008/115/EC in the case of land transit of returnees within the deadline for voluntary departure. 
All subordinate units of BBAP PFP dispose of a methodological guideline to proceed in accordance with the Directive. 
In 2011, two cases of execution of the decision on expulsion issued by other EU Member States were reported. 
These cases concerned nationals of Serbia and Croatia who were issued a decision on administrative expulsion by the Republic of Austria, and were subsequently readmitted to the territory of the SR where, after being detained in the Police Detention Department, they requested voluntary return to their country of origin. 
The Serbian national had been issued a decision on administrative expulsion in several Member States. 
5.2 Stockholm Programme 
The BBAP PFP prepared a strategy to collect and deliver information about illegal migration in the form of daily situation reports. 
These reports contain all relevant facts about state border violation or breach of the conditions of stay by aliens apprehended as illegal migrants. 
Until October 2010, this information was processed by the BBAP PFP within the irregular migration database. 
In October 2010, the illegal migration database was replaced by the information system for illegal migration and international protection IS MIGRA. 
135 Potočková, I.: Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies. 
At the same time, this information system is an important analytical tool, as it collects a number of data about apprehended illegal migrants and records the course of all procedures conducted in relation to a particular illegal migrant. 
The integration of data into a single information system simplified the analytical work and the creation of products at all levels. 
In order to ensure common procedure of BBAP PFP units in the use of IS MIGRA, an amendment to the methodology of IS MIGRA was issued on 28 July 2011. 
In relation to the collection of information about illegal migration, an instruction on the BBAP reporting service and an instruction on the processing of selected statistical information within the scope of competences of the Border Police Service and Aliens Police Services were issued. 
Operative staff from the Department of Operative Activities and Investigation West, Centre, East of NUCIM BBAP PFP finds out information about illegal routes and persons of interest from informers, collects data within criminal files and sends the statistical data to the Activities Coordination Department where the data is stored and evaluated as required. 
The activities of the extended project deal with updates of the countries' migration profiles and with the improvement of the interactive maps of Eastern migration routes (e-map).136 
The ministerial conference held on 03-04 November 2011 adopted an Action Plan which will be detailed in the years to come. 
The SR is involved in FRONTEX training activities in the framework of basic and further police training for basic and middle police management, members of the international RABIT teams working in the field of statistic methods of risk analysis, identification of false and forged travel documents, technical devices, protection of external EU borders, identification of stolen vehicles, and identification of wanted and unwanted persons. 
The SR also uses the possibility of English e-learning for the police, which is also covered by FRONTEX. 
Language training projects are also organised by the Police Corps Academy with financial assistance from FRONTEX. 
4(l)) a coordinated approach by Member States by developing the network of liaison officers in countries of origin and transit 
This network serves for the prevention of unwanted migration through the promotion of cooperation in combatting smuggling and in returns of illegal migrants by means of the activities of experts deployed to third countries. 
139 Among other duties, deployed police attachés cooperate with the BBAP PFP in the field of illegal migration, as well as monitoring and analysis of migration flows to the SR.

The purpose of this agreement is to ensure an effective return of own nationals, third-country nationals or stateless persons. 
As far as cooperation in the preparation of readmission agreement drafts at the EU level is concerned, the respective experts form the SR regularly participate and cooperate in the preparation of all texts proposed by the European Commission. 
In the reference period, draft texts of the readmission agreements with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Belarus were presented. 
In the beginning of 2011, the EU declared its intention to adopt a readmission agreement with Libya, and is willing to launch negotiation processes with China and Algeria. 
The SR concluded bilateral readmission agreements with Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Sweden, BENELUX countries, Norway, Vietnam and Switzerland. 
Yes 
The purpose of these agreements is to regulate, on a reciprocal basis, the obligation to admit own nationals and, under certain conditions, third-country nationals and stateless persons, and to define the necessary practical provisions concerning readmission (requests for readmission, deadlines, procedure related to the hand over of persons, or the means of transportation). 
The SR concluded bilateral protocols to implement readmission agreements between the EU and third countries with the Russian Federation (07 April 2010), Albania (21 January 2010), Moldova (12 May 2010) and Serbia (18 February 2011).

Besides returns as such and return assistance, the project also includes pre-return counselling, granting of a return financial contribution and post-return reintegration assistance to selected recipients by supporting approved business plans, assistance in seeking employment, material assistance, legal counselling, support of training, accommodation assistance or health assistance. 
Also, a hotline and a website are being operated, and a campaign was launched with the purpose of raising the target group's awareness about the possibility of return. 
The key objective of the campaign is to provide migrants who might need the programme services with publicly available information about the possibility of return and with access to comprehensive information. 
The basic information about the programme is available in six languages - Slovak, English, Russian, Chinese, Vietnamese and Arabic, and is placed on 40 billboards, 40 posters, 8 Continental advertisement spaces, public transport stops and ten benches in the streets and railway stations in Bratislava and Košice. 
The principal item of the campaign is the hotline number 0850 211 262, through which the IOM staff provides consultations about the assisted voluntary returns programme. 
The IOM operative staff also actively informs the target group about the possibility of return to the country of origin through the voluntary returns programme at the MoI SR asylum and detention facilities. 
The campaign is based on activities with a similar focus which were carried out in 2009 and 2010. 
In 2011, 117 persons registered in the assisted returns programme, and 95 returns were carried out. 
The total number of reintegration grants for the year 2011 is 26. 
Returnees are mainly interested in carrying out their business plans - 22 out of 26 cases. 
Material assistance was provided in three cases, and help with temporary accommodation was provided in one case.

6.2 Stockholm Programme 
BBAP PFP declared its intention to continue its involvement in the preparation of bilateral readmission agreements reflecting the situation in the field of illegal migration. 
At the same time, the SR will support to the maximum extent possible negotiations with third countries on behalf of the EU. 
Readmission agreements, at either bilateral or EU levels, contribute to an effective implementation of the return policy of the SR. 
One of the reasons is the very substance of these agreements - the facilitation of cooperation between countries upon return of their own nationals, third-country nationals or stateless persons who must be admitted by one of the parties. 
The readmission process fully respects and preserves all fundamental human rights and freedoms of individuals according to international standards. 
In 2011, the SR was engaged in a joint air return operation organised by Spain on 24 November 2011. 
This joint operation also involved other countries, namely the United Kingdom, Ireland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Norway and France, and related to a return operation to Pakistan. 
The SR also participated in a joint return operation to Pristina organised by Germany on 18 August 2011. 
The other countries involved in the operation were Belgium, France, Austria and Sweden. 
In this case, the alien was transported to the airport of the target country, but the police authorities at Pristina airport denied entry of the alien to their territory because they did not accept the emergency travel document issued by the Embassy of the Republic of Serbia. 
In connection with Slovakia's involvement in joint air expulsions, it should also be mentioned that the SR carried out expulsion of a Serbian national to the Province of Kosovo in cooperation with FRONTEX on 07 December 2011. 
The joint flight is organised by Germany, and involves also other countries, namely Austria, Sweden, Norway and France. 
In this case, the alien has been issued an emergency travel document by the Embassy of Kosovo in Vienna.

In 2012, the manual will be tested with involvement of the staff of the Border Police Service of the Police Force, and in 2012 and 2013, after translating the manual into the EU Member States' languages, all members of the Border Police Service of the Police Force will be gradually retrained. 
In 2011, the BBAP PFP created a working group to combat human trafficking. 
This working group deals with these issues from the point of view of the Border Police Service and Aliens Police Service of PF. 
At the level of the National Unit to Combat Illegal Migration of BBAP PFP, training courses on Human Trafficking for PF investigators were organised in 2011. 
In addition to that, the National Unit to Combat Illegal Migration of BBAP PFP, within a multi-sectoral working group designed to provide complex care for the victims of human trafficking, presented a proposal for a list of identification questions needed to prepare a questionnaire to identify the victims of human trafficking. 
In this respect, an internal regulation of the BBAP PFP Director was issued in 2011 in the form of a methodological guideline entitled Definition of a Precise Procedure for Members of the BBAP PFP of the Police Force in the Identification of Potential Victims of Human Trafficking, and Definition of a Precise Procedure for Members of the BBAP PFP of the Police Force after Finding out that an Alien is a Potential Victim of Human Trafficking. 
The internal regulation comprises lists of obligatorily asked questions that the member of the Police Force of the BBAP PFP will be required to ask when examining an alien in order to be able to identify him/her as victim of human trafficking. 
This regulation also includes information with precise contact data of non-governmental organisations dealing with trafficking in human beings. 
The other activities planned for 2012 include gradual retraining of the members of the Border Police Service of PF, the National Unit to Combat Illegal Migration, and Aliens Police Service of PF in the field of human trafficking with special emphasis on the newest trends, identification of victims and offenders with assistance from the Office of the Minister of Interior of the SR as the body responsible for combatting human trafficking. 
The competent authorities have not conducted any activities in third countries in 2011 that focused on awareness raising and work with communities under threat in the countries of origin. 
On the basis of a public order by the MoI SR to provide services, IOM carried out several activities targeting the prevention of and fight against human trafficking. 
The Programme includes assistance provided to victims of trafficking upon return to their countries of origin and reintegration assistance, including social, psychological and legal counselling, health assistance, labour integration and provision of safe accommodation, as well as a financial contribution to cover their basic needs. 
Thanks to the helpline, seven persons were identified in 2011 as former victims of human trafficking or as persons under threat or persons facing human trafficking (information as of 31 December 2011). 
In 2011, IOM continued providing training courses on the prevention of human trafficking. 
141 The five training sessions were attended by judges, prosecutors, operational staff and investigators of the Police Force, representatives of higher territorial units, members of BBAP PFP, representatives of selected non-governmental organisations, representatives of the Foster Home Topoľčany and Foster Home for Unaccompanied Minors Horné Orechové, as well as employees of the Information Centre to Combat Human Trafficking and Crime Prevention. 
Other training sessions were provided to catechists, community social workers and future consuls. 
In 2011, IOM also produced a movie 0800800818. 
The movie is supposed to serve as a methodological tool to conduct preventive activities among those population groups which are most exposed to the risk of human trafficking.

BORDER CONTROL 
8. Control and Surveillance at External Borders 
8.1 European Pact on Immigration and Asylum 
lll(a) more effective control of the external land, sea and air borders 
Control of the external borders of the SR is performed by a combination of physical and technical protection and operative search activities. 
The main responsibility for the practical performance of external border control in the SR is borne by the Border Police Service. 
The objective of ensuring systemic measures for a more effective border control of the SR is fulfilled by means of integrated border management (IBM). 
The measures are specified in the National Plan of Border Control Management of the Slovak Republic for the Period 2011-2014143 (hereinafter referred to as the "National Plan"). 
The National Plan is a planning document the contents of which is based on the new Schengen acquis adopted after the entry of the SR into the Schengen Area, as well as on other strategic documents of EU institutions and bodies adopted in the given period. 
The structure of the new National Plan is adapted to the four-stage model of the control of access to IBM in the SR, and to the structure of the updated Schengen Catalogue of the European Union on border control, return and readmission. 
144 The National Plan also comprises a schedule for the fulfilment of tasks resulting from the National Plan of Border Control Management for the Period 2011-2014. 
The tasks in the schedule cover the individual areas of the IBM system, such as systemic measures related to the control of the external borders of the SR, risk analysis concerning SR border control, training on SR border control, etc. 
Training is an important tool for the work of the staff of the Border Police Service and Aliens Police Service, making them better oriented in information with a European and international dimension. 
The training of the staff of the Border Police Service and Aliens Police Service of BBAP PFP is carried out through their own activities and programmes, such as European Training Day for Border Guards (ETD). 
In 2011, the third stage of the training project for the Border and Aliens Police staff of the Border Control Department under the Border Police Directorate Sobrance and at international airports was 
With regard to special training activities, a trainers' network was created at selected organisational units of BBAP PFP to ensure training on detection, falsification and forging of travel documents and other documents. 
The execution of these tasks will be ensured by the Department of Travel Documents Analysis of BBAP PFP together with experts from the Criminal and Expertise Institute of PF. 
The SR is also involved in the FRONTEX training activities. 
For more information refer to paragraph 4(k). 
III(e) deploy modern technological means for border control 
On 24 May 2011, the SR signed the Memorandum of Understanding EUROSUR at the FRONTEX headquarters in Warsaw. 
At the end of 2011, the National Communication Centre at BPD in Sobrance was completed. 
After the software and NOD were installed, the testing operation of the EUROSUR system was successfully launched in Slovakia. 
Similarly as other six EU Member States, the SR is entering data into the EUROSUR system and is testing the system under the pilot project. 
This proposal establishes a list of travel documents issued by all third countries the nationals of which fall under the visa obligation against EU Member States. 
The proposal also includes a list of documents issued by third parties, the holders of which are exempt from the visa obligation, and documents issued by Member States in which the Schengen acquis does not yet apply in full scope. 
In order to increase the capacity of the competent authorities ensuring integrated external border protection management to carry out control and supervision of the external borders, a number of measures were financed by the External Border Fund in 2011. 
The international airports in Poprad and Košice were also equipped with necessary radio-communication technology, which made the external border protection at these airports more effective. 
In connection with the building and implementation of the national section of SIS II (NS-SIS), the European Commission published the third version of technical specification for SIS II completion in 2011. 
In this respect, it was necessary to adjust the detailed analysis of the requirements for international functioning of NS-SIS according to the current technical requirements. 
This adjustment was performed in the period from April to July 2011, thanks to which everything was prepared to launch the international tests of NS-SIS in October 2011. 
The adjustment of the detailed analysis of requirements was financed by the External Border Fund. 
Due to the wear-out of the technical hardware of the SIRENE national headquarters, the IPCO started gradually replacing these facilities both at the SIRENE headquarters and at the joint contact offices in the SR. 
All these measures were financed by the External Border Fund. 
8.2 Stockholm Programme 
7(i) invites the Member States and the Commission to explore how the different types of checks carried out at the external border can be better coordinated, integrated and rationalised with a view to the twin objective of facilitating access and improving security 
In 2011, BBAP PFP carried out a partial replacement of equipment (e.g. computer equipment) used for the border checks of persons at crossing points on the external borders of the SR. 
No activities to ensure better coordination of the various types of border controls are planned for the first-line and second-line control of persons at border crossing points in 2011. 
In the forthcoming period, the EU seeks to implement an automated border control system, which is currently at preparation stage.

III(b) generalise the issue of biometric visas, improve cooperation between MSs' consulates and set up joint consular services for visas 
In the implementation of the Visa Code and VIS and issuance of biometric visas, the SR carried out the following activities in 2011: 
With the launch of VIS on 11 October 2011, the SR started issuing visas with two biometric identifiers (photo and fingerprints) at the Embassy in Cairo (North Africa region). 
As of 31 December 2011, the Embassy in Cairo reported 58 visa applications sent to VIS. 
Based on an analysis of the practical experience at this foreign mission, the SR plans to start issuing biometric visas in the Middle East in the first quarter of 2012. 
Fingerprints will also be collected at the Embassy in Tripoli after restoring its operation. 
The SR will start collecting fingerprints in other regions by the date set by the European Commission at the latest.

In 2011, the following agreements on representation in visa issuance were prepared: 
Poland 
The agreement was to be signed during the official visit of the Foreign Affairs Minister of the SR to the Republic of Poland on 16 December 2010. 
The Polish side did not manage to prepare the agreement for signing on time and, subsequently, raised a serious objection on the draft agreement.

Lithuania: 
Germany 
The original proposal of the government agreement was changed to a ministerial agreement. 
Spain 
According to the draft text of the Agreement between MoFA SR and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Spain on Mutual Representation in Visa Issuance, Spain is expected to represent the SR in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Haiti.

Spain conditioned the conclusion of the agreement with reciprocal full representation not only in Uzbekistan, but also in Minsk, which the Slovak side is not able to ensure yet for capacity reasons. 
154 Poland will represent the SR in visa issuance in Armenia and at the Consulate General in Kaliningrad in the Russian Federation. 
155 Lithuania will represent the SR in visa issuance in Georgia; the SR will represent Lithuania at the General Consulate in Shanghai in China. 
lll(d) solidarity with MS subjected to disproportionate influxes of immigrants 
In connection with the critical situation in North Africa, the SR reacted very promptly by deploying experts and technology to operations. 
In 2011, some BBAP PFP policemen participated in a RABIT operation (rapid intervention border team) at the Greek-Turkish border which reported an excessive increase in the number of illegal migrants. 
The SR deployed 12 experts in total to border control and border supervision, including equipment. 
The activities of the BBAP PFP experts were evaluated very positively. 
During the Ice Hockey World Championship in April and May 2011, the SR was actively involved in the operation activities at the Vienna-Schwechat airport. 
In the framework of METEOR operation, the SR promoted the measures adopted with the aim to increase the efficiency of border control, together with other Member States and observers from Albania, Moldova, Belarus and Russia. 
In addition, contact points were established at the airports in Bratislava and Košice with experts from other Member States and observers from Russia and Belarus with the aim to implement measures against illegal migration. 
Within the land sector, JUPITER operation was conducted at the Slovak-Ukrainian border during the Ice Hockey World Championship, again with the involvement of experts from EU Member States and observers from Russia, Moldova and Belarus. 
III(f) intensify cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit in order to strengthen border control 
In connection with the preparation of the European Football Championship in Poland and Ukraine in 2012 and with regard to the performance of seasonal works, BBAP PFP will select and prepare an expert - a document advisor to be deployed at the FM SR in Kiev during the period from April to September 2012. 
The Visa Code increased transparency and legal security in the assessment of visa applications, and ensured equal treatment of visa applicants. 
Moreover, it harmonised the rules and procedures for Schengen countries which apply the common visa policy. 
The interconnections serve for the fulfilment of

all tasks associated with the control of alphanumerical data and biometric data in the central VIS by entering biometric data upon issuing visas at border crossing points. 
For more details refer to sub-section III(b). 
IV(c) solidarity with MS which are faced with specific and disproportionate pressures on their national asylum systems 
The SR supports harmonisation through enhanced cooperation and exchange of practical experiences among the EU Member States. 
The activities of solidarity with Member States represent one of the work scopes of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), which is fully functional since June 2011 and the establishment of which the SR had clearly supported. 
This office ensures coordination and support of practical cooperation among the EU Member States, a common training system, a platform for information about the countries of origin, asylum support teams and activities to enhance solidarity. 
The SR nominated its representatives to the asylum support teams; and it has been actively involved since November, through its representative from MO MoI SR, in the teams to support Greece in the creation of a system to receive asylum applicants in asylum facilities. 
The grant application was submitted in October 2011. 
At present, the process of projects selection and approval is in place. 
IV(d) strengthen cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure better protection for people outside the territory of European Union Member States who request protection, in particular by moving, on a voluntary basis, towards the resettlement within the European Union 
On 22 December 2010, a trilateral agreement between the Government of the SR, UNHCR and IOM on the humanitarian transfer of refugees who need international protection by the SR was concluded. 
Under this agreement, co-financed by the European Refugee Fund158, the SR will provide humanitarian assistance to 100 refugees and persons under international protection for a period of six months from the day of their entry to the territory of the Slovak Republic. 
The refugees have been accommodated in the asylum facility of MoI SR in Humenne in which they will stay, similarly as other groups, six months, and after this period they will be gradually relocated to third countries. 
This activity will continue in 2012. 
In 2011, the SR participated in the final conference on the UNHCR, IOM and ICMC project Support of Relocation in the EU through Practical Co-operation among EU Member States and Other Stakeholders; the SR joined this project in 2010. 
The main objective of the project is to promote higher involvement of EU Member States into relocation activities through enhanced cooperation among the EU Member States by using the support of several stakeholders and by a coordinated practical approach; to support practical and logistic collaboration among the EU Member States implementing relocation programmes; to interconnect the different stages of the relocation process (pre-flight health checks, cultural and orientation programmes, transfer, etc.); to support and promote reception services and capacities; and to prepare recommendations for the initial phase of the integration of relocated persons into society. 
The project is being implemented by IOM, UNHCR and ICMC, and the SR will continue being involved in it. 
All special training activities for the Border Police Service staff of PF on border control and border supervision include topics related to international protection (asylum, subsidiary protection, temporary shelter). 
In 2011, a total of 846 members of the police performing direct service on the external border attended these special training courses, which represents 91% of police members assigned to the external air and land border of the SR (940 police members).

5(a develop an action plan, to be adopted by the Council, on unaccompanied minors which underpins and supplements the relevant legislative and financial instruments and combines measures directed at prevention, protection and assisted return 
The Council adopted an Action Plan on unaccompanied minors for the period 2010-2014. 
The Council will prepare a report on the Action Plan in 2012. 
In 2011, the SR participated in two regional projects concerning unaccompanied minors, implemented by the IOM and financed from the European Refugee Fund - Community Actions. 
The first project entitled Best practice and coordination of the access to care for unaccompanied minors and former minors seeking asylum aims to contribute to the creation of a joint approach of EU countries to present and former unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. 
The project coordinated by IOM Budapest and implemented in ten EU countries is based on an analysis of legislation and in-depth interviews with unaccompanied minor asylum seekers and those who are involved in the process of assessment of their applications. 
11.3 Key Statistics 
Number of unaccompanied minors 
In 2011, 169 unaccompanied minors were placed in the facilities of COLSAF, and 18 of them applied for asylum. 
For the majority of unaccompanied minors, the SR continues to be a transit country, as they seek to escape to another target country. 
V(a) conclude EU-level or bilateral agreements with the countries of origin and of transit containing clause on legal and illegal migration as well as development 
In 2011, the SR did not conclude any bilateral agreement160 on employment, but it concluded two bilateral agreements on youth mobility with Canada and New Zealand.

V(b) offer the nationals of partner countries to the East and South of Europe opportunities for the legal immigration 
In 2011, no specified measures targeting labour or circular migration were adopted, nor any special measures directed to third countries of Eastern and South Europe. 
162 The Migration Policy of the SR with a Perspective until 2020, adopted in 2011, contains several references to the regulation of legal migration, as well as references to temporary and circular migration. 
Specific measures will be prepared and implemented in 2012. 
For more details refer to sub-sections I(a-c) and 1(b). 
V(d) More effective integration of migration and development policies 
However, according to MP, the interconnection between migration and development should not be automatically reduced only to the aspect of development aid which represents just one of the tools contributing to the reduction of unwanted migration. 
On 02 November 2011, the Government of the SR approved the draft Agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Government of the Republic of Kenya on Development Cooperation. 
162 Information provided by MoLSAF SR. 
• A House Midway - This aid project is designed for the Cantonal Centre for Social Works in Sarajevo with the aim to purchase a social facility for children from foster homes who desperately need accommodation, education and social assistance. 
In the selection of families for cooperation, emphasis is put on representing all ethnic groups and on ensuring their mutual integration in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
V(e) promote co-development actions and support instrument for transferring migrants' remittances 
No measures have been implemented in 2011 or in the years before.

The Annual Report 2012 provides an overview of the most important changes in migration and asylum policies in Slovakia in the legislative and institutional fields and in practice in the period from 01 January 2012 to 31 December 2012. 
The national annual report has been compiled by the National Contact Point of the European Migration Network (EMN) for the SR in the framework of the EMN activities upon initiative of the European Commission. 
The structure and the contents of the chapters follow the specification of the European Commission and are identical for all EU Member States and Norway. 
In 2012, in spite of the early elections, no substantial changes occurred in the institutional area that would have an impact on migration and asylum policies. 
In the same year, works on an amendment act were launched; this act will inter alia amend the Act on Asylum, and it is expected to enter into effect on 01 May 2013. 
Amendments to the Act on Employment Services were also prepared in 2012. 
Migration and asylum issues did not represent an important part of political discussions, election debates or election programmes in 2012. 
The Government Manifesto deals with migration and asylum issues only marginally. 
As in previous years, the mass-media did not pay priority attention to migration and asylum issues. 
The report will also serve the national purposes of the SR by providing information on the developments in migration and asylum policies in 2012 for policy makers, experts and the general public. 
The report, as in previous years, provides information on the developments in the field of policies and legislation and the main political discussions that influenced the creation of migration and asylum policies in 2012. 
The structure of the report allows informing about the development in the SR at the national level in the context of EU developments. 
The report contains basic statistical data concerning the individual chapters, collected and published by the relevant state authorities. 
The short information reports prepared by the European Commission will also contain a general overview of the statistics on the different fields as per EU Member States and Norway describing the trends in the various areas in 2012. 
The report is divided into nine chapters and three annexes. 
The annexes describe the methodology of the preparation of this report, the terms and definitions used, relevant migration and asylum statistics, and bibliography. 
Unlike years before, in connection with the change in the structure of the specification, the entire text of the Annual Report has also been slightly modified. 
Information on the developments in the different fields are not broken down anymore to the principal text and related annexes reflecting the commitments arising from the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum and the Stockholm Programme, but it now represents a compact text divided into chapters describing the various aspects of migration and asylum. 
1.1 Structure of Asylum and Migration Policy 
General structure of the political system 
and institutional context 
As in previous years, three ministries were the principal actors in the field of migration and asylum in the SR. 
1 The MoI SR is also responsible for the protection and management of state borders and the population register, and fulfils the function of the state authority responsible for the management of 
1 Daniel Lipšic (KDH) was the Minister of Interior of the SR. 
After the parliamentary elections held on 10 March 2012, Róbert Kaliňák (Smer-Social Democracy) was appointed as new Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Interior on 04 April 2012. 
four EU funds under the General Programme Solidarity and Migration Flows Management (European Refugee Funds, European Fund for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, European Return Fund, and the External Borders Fund)2 and also for the implementation of the Migration Policy of the SR. 
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR3 is competent in the field of labour migration and integration of foreigners. 
Another field of activity of the MoLSAF SR is labour inspection through the National Labour Inspectorate Office, coordination of the preparation of the strategy of employment, labour market policy, labour relations, social insurance, social assistance, social protection of children and social guardianship, including social care for unaccompanied minors, persons granted asylum and other categories of foreigners. 
3 Jozef Mihál (SaS) was the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR. 
In 2012, the Managing Committee for the Migration and Integration of Foreigners continued its activities, holding four meetings,5 as well as the Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Migration and Integration of Foreigners (MEKOMIC) did with one meeting. 
General structure of the legal system 
The general structure of the legal system in the field of migration and asylum is given by the hierarchy of the different sources of law in the SR. 
The Constitution and the constitutional laws are legal norms with the highest legal force. 
The sources of law also include legally bind ing EC and EU acts which have precedence over the laws of the SR pursuant 
6 MEKOMIC aims to provide the representatives of relevant state authorities and non-state institutions, trade unions, organisations and experts with a platform for a mutual exchange of information about their activities, experience and needs in the field of migration and integration of foreigners living in the SR. 
to Article 7, par. 2 of the Constitution of the SR. 
Considering the continental system of law exercised in the SR, court precedents in the form of decisions of general courts are not generally binding, and the decisions of the Constitutional Court of the SR are only considered as sources of law in this respect. 
The act specifies the criteria and procedures for the granting of different types of residence, stipulates the rights and obligations of foreign nationals and other entities, and defines the relevant control and sanction measures to prevent illegality and breach of obligations. 
The act also defines the Police Force's competences in securing the state borders by specifying the rights and obligations of the different bodies and of the sanctions in the event of the breach thereof. 
The act also specifies the status of the family members of Union citizens, while extending the definition of this group of aliens with two new categories. 
The act introduces new types of temporary residence, and in some cases it extends the maximum period of the granted temporary residence permit and the minimum period for its renewal. 
The act reduces the minimum required period of a residence permit from five to four years on the basis of which the holder of a permanent residence permit can apply for permanent residence for an unlimited period of time. 
The act makes tolerated stay available to a new category of aliens while respecting their private and family life, and with the aim to promote the support provided to the victims of human trafficking. 
In connection with the modifications of the provisions on administrative expulsion and detention, the act introduces alternatives to detention. 
16 Act No. 293/2007 Coll. on Recognition of Professional Qualification. 
22 Act No. 171/1993 Coll. on the Police Force. 
Overview of Asylum and Migration Policy Developments in the Slovak Republic 
2.1 Political Developments 
On 04 April 2012, the President of the SR appointed Robert Fico as Prime Minister, and also appointed new ministers. 
The new government has 15 members: the Prime Minister, three Vice-Prime Ministers who are also ministers (of interior, finances, and foreign and european affairs), one VicePrime Minister without portfolio responsible for investments, and ten ministers. 
Further to the changes in the government, there were 
For more details see the Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies in the Slovak Republic 2011. 
also changes at the positions of ministers relevant to migration and asylum policies. 
Migration and asylum issues were not tackled in the election debates. 
The analysis of the programme documents of the political parties that entered the parliament suggests that references to migration issues were marginal. 
The government party Smer-SD mentions migration and demography as one of the main challenges for the future. 
The party programme also deals with the brain-drain and the creation of suitable conditions for the return of qualified workers. 
29 This issue is also addressed by the election programmes of the SaS and Most-Hid. 
30 The SDKÚ-DS party mentions the need to facilitate the arrival and staying in Slovakia of highly qualified migrants and businessmen, including students and researchers. 
The party stresses that Slovakia must be more active in the global talent competition and must increase its competitiveness compared to other countries31. 
The KDH election programme 
28 For more details see http://www.vlada.gov.sk/ (consulted on 11/09/ 2012). 
29 The Programme Objectives of the Party Smer-Social Democracy for the Election Period 2012-16 are available at http://strana-smer. sk/sites/default/files/uploads/dokumenty/programove_zameranie_2012-2016.doc (consulted on 11/09/2012). 
deals with migration issues to the largest extent, which relates to the fact that a member of this party was the Minister of Interior in the previous election period, and the election programme reflects the continuation of his policy. 
The programme emphasises the need to create an Immigration and Naturalisation Office that should fulfil tasks in the field of migration management, aliens, residence and asylum agenda, including citizenship. 
It also stresses the need to promote a strict asylum policy and appropriate language and cultural integration of migrants. 
Like other parties, KDH mentions the support for the return of qualified Slovaks living abroad, mainly through measures in the field of migration and better involvement of Slovak countrymen in seeking solutions from the current crisis. 
32 The party OĽaNO does not deal with migration at all. 
2.2 Overall Developments in Asylum and Migration 
In 2012, no new migration and asylum policies or strategies were approved or changed compared to 2011, mainly because it was election year. 
As mentioned above, migration and asylum issues did not meet with much interest during the election campaign, and were not presented in the mass media more often than in the year before. 
In connection with the development of policies at a broader scale with an impact on various migration and asylum areas, we should mention the new Government Manifesto33 which in principle reflects the election programme of the party Smer-SD as the only party in government. 
32 KDH Programme, available at http://www.kdh.sk/program (consulted on 11/09/2012). 
More generally, the Government Manifesto declares the need to pay attention to the development of bilateral cooperation with the EU neighbours-in particular with the Western Balkan and Eastern Partnership countries. 
Since these countries record the biggest numbers of migrants coming to the SR (Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova), this declaration is important with a view to the migration policy. 
As far as political debates are concerned, migration and asylum issues did not represent a priority for politicians in 2012. 
What can yet be repeatedly observed on the political scene are discussions on citizenship in relation to the act adopted in 2010 as a reaction to the adoption of the act on state citizenship in Hungary in the first half of 2010 on the initiative of the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. 
Under this act, anybody who has ascendants from Hungary and who speaks Hungarian can apply for Hungarian citizenship. 
These conditions apply to the majority of the members of the Hungarian minority living in Slovakia. 
Robert Fico's government (2006-10) responded by an act under which foreign citizenship can be obtained only with the loss of the Slovak one. 
Iveta Radičová's government (2010-12) planned to modify this act but did not succeed. 
Compared to the previous year when migration issues were discussed in the mass media to a larger extent, especially in connection with the adoption of the new Migration 
Traditionally, irregular migration issues raised most attention34, especially in relation to the discovery of a tunnel under the SlovakUkrainian border which served for the smuggling of goods and humans35, and to the fight against human trafficking in view of the fact that human trafficking is increasingly not only a problem related to females, but also to males, and its purpose is not only prostitution, but also beggary and forced labour. 
36 The public awareness was also raised by the fact that the SR ended up in the top group of countries with the most effective measures in combatting human trafficking and assistance provided to victims of human trafficking according to the evaluation report of the US government on combatting trafficking in human beings. 
36 For example, plus 7 dní weekly from 03/07/2012 - Ľudia ako tovar; Šarm weekly from 14/08/2012 - Otroci, JOJ TV from 29/08/2012 - Prevádzači v detských domovoch; JOJ TV from 10/09/2012 - Svoje obete často dobre poznajú. 
02. Overview of Asylum and Migration Policy Developments in the Slovak Republic 
In 2012, the relevant ministries continued detailing the Migration Policy with a Perspective until 202043 through Action Plans for the period 2012-13.44The specific measures were 
The information on the preparation of Action Plans was also discussed by the Managing Committee for Migration and Integration. 
In May 2012, the Government of the SR took note at its meeting of the document Summary Report on the State of Fulfilment of Migration Policy Tasks, Plans and Objectives, which included its detailing through Action Plans. 
45 The discussion on the document took place only at the level of the ministries and experts, and its further detailing did not raise a wider public discussion either. 
In general, migration and asylum did not form a principal topic of political discussions in 2012, and did not have an impact on the changes that occurred in the structure of the political system throughout the reference period. 
44 The relevant ministries are: MoI SR, MoFEA SR, MoLSAF SR, 
Ministry of Economy of the SR, Ministry of Culture of the SR, Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sports of the SR, Ministry

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2012 - Slovak Republic 
This chapter of the report brings information on the relevant policy and legislation developments in the field of legal migration and mobility, including family reunification, integration, citizenship, and also visa policy, Schengen measures related to the monitoring of borders and cooperation with the Frontex agency. 
It also identifies the specific developments at the national level in connection with the implementation of the EU policies and legislation and the use of EU financial instruments. 
The report also provides information on the activities of non-governmental and international organisations, in particular on the implementation of projects that have largely contributed to the development in the field of legal migration and integration. 
In 2012, no significant parliamentary debates or discussions took place among the experts or wider public. 
3.1 Economic Migration 
Traditionally, the SR has been a country of emigration rather than a country of immigration46. 
Before 1989, foreigners came to then Czechoslovakia from the countries of the former East bloc mainly for study reasons. 
Slovakia faced the same situation after 1990 during the transition period when it was perceived as a country of origin of economic migrants and as their transit country47 rather than as a country of destination of labour migration.

cilitated and supported labour migration. 
The SR responded to this situation and to the increasing need of obtaining highly qualified workers by preparing the Migration Policy of the SR with a Perspective until 2020 (MP) in 2011. 
In the field of legal migration, the aim of the MP is to facilitate the admission of economic migrants and their employment in line with the needs of the national economy and of the labour market with an emphasis on the admission of highly-qualified employees, scientific workers and, if needed, other qualified migrants to fill scarce jobs.

migration which would serve as a basis for the assessment of the possibility of its application for the purposes of migrants' admission in the SR and of the impacts on the existing legal system in relation to managed economic migration. 
Initial steps should also be taken to implement the scoring system and to define the indicators (level of education, language proficiency, salary, scarce professions) for which points will be assigned, and to define the weight of the different indicators. 
In 2012, an analysis of the monitoring of scarce jobs and of the labour market was expected to be conducted, and the introduction of quotas for some work positions was supposed to be assessed, including quotas for certain types of trade licences on the basis of analyses. 
Since early parliamentary elections were held in 2012 and 'due to the demanding character of the preparation of such analyses, such measures will be prepared mainly in 2013'. 
In 2012, labour migration management within the SR has sought to compensate for the shortage of available labour forces on the labour market, especially in scarce professions. 
The admission and employment of highly qualified workers, scientists, stu-

dents and other qualified migrants are supported in particular. 
This type of temporary residence has a special status. 
A third-country national who obtains in the territory of the SR temporary residence on the basis of a Blue Card, may stay and work in the SR, provided that he/she is admitted to highly qualified employment, has a higher qualification (i.e. a document on higher education and experience in the respective expert field), and a work contract or a written promise by the employer55 about employing him/ her. 
The employment contract of such worker must ensure an income of at least 1.5 times the current average monthly salary of an employee in the respective sector of the national economy56 which means that his/her income may not be higher than the income of an employee at a comparable work position in the given EU Member State. 
In this area, an amendment to the Act on Employment Services was prepared in 2012 (with planned effectiveness in 2013). 
This amendment proposes to extend the powers of COLSAF; cancel the need to present a document confirming the possibility to fill a vacancy concerning highly qualified employment (for the purpose of granting a Blue Card); keep central records of issued and cancelled documents confirming the possibility to fill a vacancy related to highly qualified employment; and establish the employer's obligation to notify the labour office of vacancies, their numbers and description prior to the filing of the application for a document confirming the possibility of a vacancy concerning highly qualified employment for a third-country national. 
This should ensure better awareness about the possibilities of employment for persons applying for the Blue Card. 
In 2012, 25 applications for a document confirming the possibility of filling a vacancy were sent to the COLSAF, corresponding to highly qualified employment for a third-country national, of which ten were refused. 
In this connection, seven temporary residence permits-Blue Cards-were issued in 2012. 
This statistical data suggests that the SR has failed so far to attract large numbers of qualified migrants through the harmonised EU Blue Card instrument for highly-qualified workers from third countries. 
54 In this respect, the COLSAF publishes on its website monthly statistical information on the state, development and structure of employment, and makes analyses and prognoses of the labour market development. 
55 In this case, he/she must present the employment contract within 30 days after taking over the residence document. 
56 The current average monthly salary amounts in 2012 in the respective sectors of the Slovak economy are available at http:// portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=44084 (consulted on 28/11/2012). 
03. Legal Migration and Mobility 
The practical application of this act has shown certain shortcomings and problems in the use of compensation mechanisms as substitute measures eliminating possible differences in education or vocational training. 
The draft law therefore details the respective provisions by establishing specific conditions under which a particular compensation mechanism can be imposed, as well as the requirements for the implementation thereof. 
With regard to the adjustment of compensation mechanisms, the very process related to the recognition of qualification documents and special qualifications has also been reviewed with the aim to eliminate any inconsistencies and ensure unification and better transparency of this legislation. 
A draft agreement on a working holiday scheme between the SR and Japan, and a draft agreement with Australia are at the stage of preparation. 
concluded (Australia) or approved (Serbia), and negotiations on such agreements were conducted with Japan and Russia. 
In this regard no measures were taken in the SR to prevent brain waste in relation to third countries in 2012. 
3.2 Family Reunification 
The new legislation has replaced the incomplete transposition of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of the citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, as a result of which the SR now fully respects the rights guaranteed by the directive to the citizens of the Union and their family members. 
In order to harmonise Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification with the national legislation, the provisions governing permanent residence have also been modified. 
The possibility to obtain permanent residence for a period of five years has been extended to dependent children over 18 years of age who cannot take care of themselves due to long-term unfavourable health condition, which was not possible under the previous regulation. 
This provision excludes healthy dependent children over 18 years of age from obtaining permanent residence for five years; however, they can apply for a temporary residence permit for the purpose of study. 
The law lowered the limit for the requested duration of stay on the basis of which the holder of a permanent residence permit may apply for permanent residence for an indefinite period of time from five years to four years. 
Another new provision in the act is the possibility to grant a national visa to the family members of aliens with granted asylum and to aliens under subsidiary protection, provided that they do not pose a threat to the state security or public order. 
This category of persons is entitled to be granted the national visa, and represents an exception in the possibility to appeal against the non-granting or cancellation of the visa, which does not apply to other aliens. 
The need to grant national visas to this category of persons originated in connection with their special status and the efforts of the SR to ensure family reunification of the persons with granted asylum or of the persons under subsidiary protection. 
According to the current legislation, a work permit is not required in the case of a thirdcountry national who has been granted a temporary residence permit for the purpose 
03. Legal Migration and Mobility 
3.3 Students and Researchers 
The Act on Residence of Aliens which entered into effect on 01 January 2012 introduced certain advantages related to the application for a temporary residence permit for the purpose of study compared to applicants for a temporary residence permit for a purpose other than study59: 
60 I.e. under Art. 24, 25 and 26 of the Act on Residence of Aliens. 
61 This type of visa is charged with a fee of EUR 33 under item 
• the process of making a decision on granting the temporary residence is reduced to a maximum of 30 days; 
• they are exempt from payment of the administrative fee for the filing of the application for temporary residence for the purpose of study; 
• they are exempt from the obligation to demonstrate accommodation (in the case of study at a higher education institution). 
The amendment to the Act on Employment Services, which is expected to enter into effect in 2013, assumes extension of the category of third-country nationals who are not required to hold a work permit to third-country nationals who have successfully completed their studies at a secondary school or at a higher education institution within the SR. 
The law amendment will however not enable students from third countries to stay in the territory of the SR for a certain period of time after the completion of their studies, and try seeking a job. 
62 This exception also applies to foreign students under Slovak Government programmes or students studying on the basis of bilateral agreements. 
In general, the mobility of students is governed by bilateral agreements. 
More details are provided in the EMN study Migration of International Students to the SR. 
63 The study was presented in the SR during the international conference on this topic in the framework of EMN activities. 
Representatives of state institutions, universities, non-governmental organisations and diplomatic missions abroad working in the field of migration and internationalisation of higher education, as well as individual researches, students, teachers and journalists participated at the conference. 
The conference included a panel discussion of the representatives of the state and public sectors on the contribution and impacts of the migration of international students. 
The information on the conference and on the results of the EMN research was published by some Slovak dailies64, and the Slovak Radio also brought a report on the event on 25 December 2012. 
3.4 Other Legal Migration 
The MP Action Plans also state the need to provide information through immigration portals, (multilingual) websites, brochures and leaflets, and to raise general awareness of migrants through information campaigns on illegal work, smuggling, trafficking in human beings, and on the possible risks of labour migrations and on assistance possibilities. 
Information on the routes to and conditions of legal migration, and on the rights and obligations of foreigners related to their planned or current stay in the territory of the SR can be found on the websites of relevant state institutions, as follows: 
• website of the MoI SR www.minv.sk. 
This website publishes EU legislation governing the entry and stay of aliens in the territory of the EU and visa issues. 
Most of the information is available in the Slovak language, while the

• multilingual information brochures 
In addition to advisory services, MIC IOM publishes multilingual information brochures with the aim to reach clients who cannot visit the MIC IOM in person and need to get basic information on their residence and various other aspects of life in Slovakia. 
The brochures are also distributed to relevant partners who come into contact with foreigners, e.g. Aliens Police Departments of PF, diplomatic missions of the SR abroad, consular offices of foreign states in the SR, offices of labour, social affairs and family, other state and non-state institutions, and also to other persons interested in these topics during public events. 
• website 
The website www.mic.iom.sk contains analytically gathered legislative and practical information on the main areas of foreigners' life in Slovakia in three languages: Slovak, English and Russian. 
With regard to the depth of the information and the contents, it is a unique information database in Slovakia which is used not only by foreigners, but also by relevant institutions and experts working in the field of integration. 
The website also contains information brochures and leaflets available for download. 
• days of specialised counselling 
MIC IOM organised One Stop Shop events- days of specialised counselling-on 02 August 2012 and 15 November 2012 in Bratislava and on 27 September 2012 in Košice. 
Foreigners could talk to the staff of the Aliens Police 
The pilot consultation days met with a positive response; complex counselling by the representatives of several institutions was used by 40 foreigners from Egypt, India, Colombia, Nicaragua, Syria, the USA and other countries, living in Slovakia. 
A positive role in the provision of information to foreigners is played by the EU Immigration Portal which summarises all required information that an alien needs prior to his/ her entry to the country to ensure his/her legal residence. 
As required, the SR updates the necessary data and information published on the portal. 
Some information is also provided by the EURES network. 
Information on the possibility of entering the programme of assisted returns, which is implemented in the SR exclusively by the IOM in cooperation with the MoI SR, is provided through the specialised website www.avr.iom.sk or via phone, e-mail or personal consultations and specialised brochures. 
Information is also provided through the Voluntary Return European Network (VREN). 
70 For more details visit also www.mic.iom.sk (consulted on 28/11/2012); the statistical data was provided by MIC IOM. 
In addition, the MoLSAF SR as the CFI sponsor prepares annual summary reports on the implementation of measures arising therefrom. 
The new integration policy aims to improve the multidimensional aspects of integration in areas such as: employment, education, cultural orientation, civic participation, language skills, and access to citizenship. 
The final outcome will cross-sectorally influence integration management and its improvement, which will have an impact on the economic, demographical and social life of foreigners, people granted asylum, and persons with refugee status in Slovakia. 
The new integration policy will intensively deal with integration indicators give the absence of activities in this field and quality data on integration indicators as a result of a small number of foreigners in Slovakia. 
The wide expert public, representatives of the state sector, non-governmental organisations, selfgovernments and foreigners' communities have all been invited to participate in the preparation of the document. 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2012 - Slovak Republic 
In the framework of its activities in the field of integration policy, of which it is the sponsor, the MoLSAF SR organised, besides the CFI update, meetings with foreigners' communities in Slovakia twice a year. 
The representatives of the Afghan, Chinese, Islamic, Somali, Ukrainian and Vietnamese communities and the representatives of non-governmental and international organisations are invited to these meetings. 
At these meetings, the MoLSAF SR informs about the current activities, events and published information concerning foreigners' issues. 
The ministry also involves foreigners' communities in the preparation of various policies by submitting draft documents and concepts for discussion. 
In 2012, the MoLSAF SR continued organising the Forum for Integration with the participation of relevant representatives of the state and public administration and of the non-governmental sector, international organisations and foreigners' communities. 
During the meetings it is stressed that the issues concerning the integration of aliens is highly topical. 
The labour market prognoses indicate that employers must raise their labour force demands not only in long term, but also in short term. 
The State Secretary of the MoLSAF SR warned that Slovakia would either become 'the victim of an unrestrained process', or it would have a 'clear concept' to manage and rectify this process. 
It also takes positions and opinions on issues concerning the employment of third-country nationals within the SR. 
On the international level, the SR has been actively involved in the work of the National Contact Points for Integration, and has regularly participated in related meetings. 
Regarding the cooperation with countries of origin, the SR has not yet cooperated with countries of origin specifically in the field of migration management. 
Migration and its management have been dealt with as part of wider cooperation and general agreements with these countries, for example, in the field of education, business cooperation, or development aid. 
Unlike in parliamentary and presidential elections, aliens have the right to vote in municipal elections, since the citizenship of the SR does not constitute the condition for voting in this case. 
In line with the employment policy and active labour market policy, much attention has been paid in 2012 to the integration of persons with a disadvantaged position on the labour market, including third-country nationals with asylum and migrants, mainly in relation to the provision of assistance in material need. 
In 2012, assistance in material need is monthly provided to 267 aliens in average. 
Besides counselling services described in sub-chapter 3.4, MIC IOM also conducts other activities aimed to facilitate foreigners' integration in the SR, especially:74 
• education and re-training courses 
MIC IOM provides financial contributions to re-training and training courses according to applicants' needs in relation to their integration into the society and entry to the labour market (e.g. IT vocational training, accounting, language courses, etc.). 
In 2012, contributions were granted to 65 clients on the basis of their profile assessment. 
• open Slovak language course

guage knowledge in a given field. 
In 2012, 403 persons participated in the language training cycles. 
In 2012, a total of 194 persons attended the training cycles. 
Their aim is to raise awareness on the procedures and on the rights and obligations of foreigners in the most important areas of their life in Slovakia. 
Depending on the topic and the interest of the target group, the leaflets are published in printed and electronic forms in six language versions: Slovak, English, Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Arabic. 
The leaflets address not only foreigners, but also 
Legal advisory services on residence and citizenship 3 - the aim of the project is to provide effective and comprehensive legal assistance to third-country nationals on issues concerning residence and citizenship. 
Multi-cultural and community information meetings organised by cultural mediators75 have been the principal MIC IOM activity in the field of mutual inter-cultural exchange since 2006. 
These meetings represent a unique communication link between foreigners' communities and the Slovak population. 
The information meetings are organised as cultural or social events, discussions and workshops. 
With the aim of building the capacities of cultural mediators and representatives of foreigners' communities, the MIC IOM prepared in 2012 an intensive training course for cultural mediators to teach them competences and skills needed in a counselling process which are important for their work with foreigners and foreigners' communities within field-work. 
Through training organised by the MIC IOM, cultural mediators obtain basic skills and competences, increasing the professional level of their work. 
BAKHITA II - this project aims to provide training, expert services and job opportunities to foreigners through increased expert capacities of those involved. 
The main aim of this programme is to inform foreigners living in Slovakia, through the national TV broadcasting programme Integruj! 
(Integrate!), about all the important aspects of life in Slovakia, and the general public about the life of foreigners in Slovakia through the presentation of their community life. 
A media training course for the representatives of the different communities was held as part of this project. 
The training aimed to present the media environment in Slovakia and the application of theoretical knowledge in practice. 
this project develops, through the training programme accredited at the MoESRS SR, the competences of teachers in education, and integration of the children of third-country nationals at Slovak elementary schools.

The aim of the festival, among other things, was to develop relationships between the general population and foreigners' communities, and to offer them a space for presentation. 
The festival included cultural events, e.g. discussions, movie screening and concerts. 
In 2012, the SR joined the regional project Next Door Family, supported by EIF (Community Action). 
Approximately 210 family meetings with around 1,800 persons involved thus organised in different European countries on one day. 
The joint lunch was held on 18 November 2012, and there were 16 meetings in nine towns within Slovakia.

3.7.2 Schengen Governance 
The SR entered the Schengen Area in 2007. 
In 2005-07, it was subject to the first Schengen evaluation focused on the implementation of the Schengen acquis. 
These actions were also detailed in the previous document National Plan for Border Control Management of the Slovak Republic 2011-14. 
For more information refer to the EMN Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies in 2011 and in the EMN study Practical Measures to Combat Irregular Migration in the SR. 
3.7.3 Border Monitoring 
The measures in this field mainly include technical modernisation of the external border facilities, police training, and international cooperation. 
The measures related to border protection in the context of irregular migration are described in sub-chapter 4.1. 
These activities are usually carried out on the basis of 'partnership' academy networks. 
Information is distributed to the police staff through different projects, such as FOOS - web portal providing basic information on Frontex operational activities, JORA91, FMM - media monitoring, and V-Aula providing information on the Frontex training activities. 
The BBAP PFP departments have created a network of trainers for the detection of forged and altered travel and other documents (visas, identification cards, residence permits, and motor vehicle documents). 
This information was provided by the BBAP PFP and the Foreign Aid Department of the MoI SR. 
91 The JORA project aims to facilitate the reporting on joint operations and modernise the system (the filling in of Excel forms sent by e-mail should be replaced with a web application), and it is expected to become a part of EUROSUR. 
Training courses also concerned the detection of the victims of human trafficking (for more information see Chapter 7) and the promotion of inter-cultural skills (for more details see sub-chapter 3.5). 
In the area of international cooperation in 2012, the meeting of the chief border attorneys of the SR and Ukraine was held, adopting the Plan for the Development of Cooperation between BBAP PFP and the State Border Service of Ukraine for the Years 2013 and 2014. 
The purpose of this document is to continue in the development of cooperation and coordination of joint efforts in ensuring security at the Slovak-Ukrainian state borders. 
The plan specifies the following areas of cooperation: 
• promoting cooperation in protecting the common border; 
• measures to improve border control; 
• joint assessment of irregular migration threats at the Slovak-Ukrainian border; 
• prevention and detection of new forms and methods of illegal activities, 
92 The information and statistics were provided by the BBAP PFP. 
Six police experts with official motor vehicles were also deployed to the Poseidon Land joint operation at the Greek-Turkish border. 
The aim of this operation was to increase the overall effectiveness of the border supervision to prevent illegal entry to the EU territory. 
The Jupiter and Focal Point Land joint operations are carried out at the external land border with Ukraine throughout the year, with the SR being the host country. 
In 2012, Slovak police experts have also participated in the joint Neptun operation with Greece as one of the host countries, and have been also involved in the Eurocup operation. 
The test operation of this project was launched in December 2011 and is planned to last until 2013, when the draft EU regulation on the EUROSUR system implementation is expected to be signed in all EU countries. 
The training activities of the Frontex Agency are described in sub-chapter 3.7.3. 
93 This information was provided by the BBAP PFP. 
This chapter brings information on the measures taken to combat irregular migration, including returns, focusing on the political and legislative developments at the national level and in the EU context. 
It also summarises the debates and media outcomes in this field, projects financed from EU funds, and their impact on international cooperation. 
Irregular Migration and Return 
4.1 Irregular Migration 
For more details see sub-chapter 3.7.2. 
Irregular migration is separately discussed in a MP chapter, and is also detailed in Action Plans. 
The SR stresses that it efficiently fights against all forms of irregular migration, while taking note of the human rights aspects connected with this phenomenon. 
All measures have been continuous- 
Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2012 - Slovak Republic 
ly implemented in the context of the abovementioned strategic documents and of the repeated Schengen evaluation. 
Further to the statistics on irregular migration in the SR, irregular migration in 2012 increased by 21 per cent compared to the year 2012. 
This increase can be attributed to the ever growing number of migrants from African countries. 
The number of illegal state border crossings rose by 69%. 
As in 2011, the most frequent irregular migrants were the nationals of Ukraine, Somalia, Moldova and Afghanistan. 
Table 3 in Annex 2 provides an overview of irregular migration in the SR in 2011 and 2012 (illegal state border crossing and illegal stay). 
For the media, irregular migration is the most reported migration issue. 
In 2012, the media informed again about the individual cases of irregular migrants captured at the external border, these being persons illegally staying in the territory of the SR who were either expelled from the country or applied for asylum. 
Such sporadic reports, however, did not produce a wider discussion, nor had an impact on the change of legislation or political discussion in the parliament. 
The BBAP PFP informs about these cases through its section on the website of the MoI SR. 
The measures to combat irregular migration, such as improvement of the technical facilities on the external borders and the related training courses and cooperation with Frontex Agency with a special focus on the GreekTurkish border, are described in sub-chapters 3.7.3 and 3.7.4. 
In the context of the fight against irregular migration the SR uses at the central, regional and local levels a system of technical and physical state border protection of the external border. 
The entire system is detailed on the basis of the recommendations of the EU Schengen Catalogue for border control, return and readmission. 
The measures required to solve the negative impacts of extensive migration waves are defined in the approved National Plan for Border Control Management of the SR 2011-14. 
All levels (central, regional and local) dispose of detailed instructions for statistics collection and reporting. 
Operational analyses are prepared at the regional level on the basis of instructions and set methods. 
The purpose of the analysis is to ensure optimum use of resources for internal security in the given period. 
At the same time, the operational analysis is one of the principal sources for the preparation of analyses at the central level and serves as a background for reports on the security situation in the SR. 
Tactical analyses of situations at the local level are carried out by appointed basic unit staff. 
Such analyses consist of the processing and use of relevant information for the profiling of tasks related to internal security protection in real time. 
The profiling of tasks is made with the aim to identify probable perpetrators. 
Besides the above-mentioned measures and analytical work, the conclusion of readmission agreements is one of the most efficient tools to combat irregular migration. 
In this regard, the SR signed a readmission agreement with Austria (Agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the Austrian Federal Government on the readmission of persons with illegal stay (Readmission Agreement)) and an Implementing Protocol to the Agreement on 16 February 2012. 
The agreement came into force on 13 May 2012. 
The aim of the agreement is to facilitate the fight against irregular migration and promote the cooperation of relevant Slovak and Austrian authorities in this area. 
The readmission procedures will become simplified thanks to this agreement. 
Cooperation in the field of readmission agreements at the bilateral level also runs under the border attorney activities in the form of personal meetings of border attorneys from different countries and their representatives, held alternately in the territories of the parties to the bilateral readmission agreement. 
The border attorney meetings deal with practical issues concerning common borders of the two states, joint security activities of the two states, or crime within the common state border sections. 
Cooperation is also developed in the implementation of readmission agreements and police transports through the territories of the contracting states. 
An important aspect of cooperation in the execution of readmissions is cooperation between executive units and joint contact offices which fulfil tasks ensuring the execution of readmissions and transports. 
At the EU level, Slovak experts regularly attend meetings to prepare texts of readmission agreements. 
An important aspect of the fight against irregular migration is cooperation with the countries of origin and transit countries, the enhancement of their capacities, and prevention of irregular migration from these countries. 
The partner department in Romania was also visited. 
These activities were carried out in order to coordinate the joint actions in the framework of international cooperation in combating organised crime connected with smuggling and irregular migration, and to discuss joint actions, cooperation and exchange of information in combating irregular migration. 
The aim of the working meeting of the representatives of all stakeholders in Moldova was to carry out the activity under the Mobility Partnership with Moldova through a two-day seminar (in September 2012) for the Moldovan operational unit dealing with organised irregular migration and trafficking in human beings within Moldova (activity under the CETIR programme (Centre for the Transfer of Experience in Integration and Reforms)).97 During this meeting, the work of the BBAP PFP was presented, especially the ways of protecting the Schengen border with Ukraine and the related fight against irregular migration ensured by the specialised National Unit to Combat Irregular Migration (NUCIM) of the BBAP PFP. 
The participants also discussed the possibilities of international cooperation at the operational level between NUCIM BBAP PFP and the Centre for the Fight against Trafficking in Human Beings of the Ministry of Interior of Moldova, and the ways of exchanging operational information, 
on the basis of which another working meeting of the competent representatives was held in Romania and Moldova in 2012. 
The aim of this meeting was to discuss the joint actions, cooperation and exchange of information in combating irregular migration under the on-going EMPACT - FIMATHU project. 
98 The operational meeting in Moldova aimed to exchange information and request collaboration in the investigation of an organised group in matters concerning smuggling in the territory of the SR where a Moldovan national was identified as the chief organiser of criminal activities. 
Throughout the project duration, Slovakia will train the staff of state authorities in Moldova. 
It seeks to promptly respond to specific requirements of the partner country by using the experience and with active participation of Slovak ministries and other institutions. 
CETIR puts emphasis on the enhancement of reform efforts, on the realisation of the European perspective and improving good management of public matters through partnership consultations in specific sectors and state institutions. 
98 The principal project activities are joint work meetings of involved countries with the purpose to coordinate the joint actions and the mutual exchange of operative information on irregular migration through the Western Balkan with the aim to disintegrate organised groups. 
04. Irregular Migration and Return 
The purpose of the workshop was to enhance the knowledge of the participants on migration terminology; understand the development of migration trends in the world and in Moldova; obtain general information on the international migration law, the European migration acquis, and Moldovan national legislation on migration; understand the duties of the state in migration management; enhance the knowledge on the current migration management system in Moldova and on the importance of inter-institutional and international cooperation in the field of migration; and understand the relationship between migration institutions and the civil society. 
Inter alia, the SR provided information on the Common European Asylum System. 
It is inevitable to particularly highlight the benefits of the training for trainers which has been important not only for Moldovan, but also foreign experts. 
Another activity was undertaken under the auspices of the Police of the Czech Republic, where a criminal case (KATER operation) was examined concerning a suspicion of committed crimes of irregular migration directly affecting the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia, and Austria. 
Concurrence was ensured under very close bilateral cooperation with the partner institution in Hungary with the aim evaluate past cooperation in combating irregular migration and organised forms of smuggling with a focus on the Balkan route, getting acquainted with the current issues of irregular migration at the HungarianSerbian state border section, and arrange joint actions to reveal organised groups of smugglers who provide for accommodation and subsequent transport of irregular migrants from Hungary to the SR (especially the nationals of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan). 
At the same time, the NUCIM BBAP PFP was involved in joint working meetings and joint activities under the operational action plan of the FIMATHU project (see also above). 
NUCIM BBAP PFP prepared a draft plan of 13 activities for the period 2013-15. 
Further to the request by Hungary in connection with the development of the operational situation in the activities of organised criminal groups carrying out smuggling through the territory of the Western Balkan, the following items have been included in the operational action plan: 2.2 FIMATHU operation targeting illegal border crossing through the TurkishGreek parts of the external borders, through the Western Balkan to Hungary, Austria and other Member States. 
Since NUCIM BBAP PFP deals with similar cases, the representative of NUCIM asked for partnership in the FIMATHU project immediately at the meeting. 
This request was accepted by the founding members Hungary and Austria. 
In the fight against irregular migration, the SR cooperates and is active within several networks and international organisations or platforms and agencies, such as: 
the SR actively participated in these activities. 
The participating states fill in and upload documents to the respective ICONET directory in accordance with the set parameters and within the set deadlines. 
On the basis of this data, Frontex processes its data products and presents them to the representatives of EU Member States and associated countries at regular meetings of the FRAN community. 
The data constitute the subject of expert discussion with the possibility of clarifying possible problems in the collection or interpretation of data on irregular migration. 
In the framework of cooperation with Frontex, the SR also joined the EDF - false documents project in 2012. 
A representative of the SR attends regular meetings of the EDF group which consists of representatives of Frontex and of Member States. 
Since 2012, the SR and other Member States have provided detailed statistical data on false documents on a monthly basis, and also sends bi-monthly analytical reports on false documents. 
As in the case of the FRAN group, the data is entered into ICONET through the CIRCABC network. 
Within the NFP SR cooperates with other countries in ensuring exchange of information on forged and altered travel documents, and about the new means and trends in irregular migration through the external border - airport. 
The work of the focal point comprises exchange of information at the time of dealing with a current situation or problem at the external border of the SR - airport. 
Whenever necessary, the police officers working under the NFP are in contact with other national focal points of other EU Member States, and also with international airports in third countries. 
The NFP office reports the cases of forgery and alteration of travel documents detected at the external air border to all NFPs within the EU by means of alerts. 
DSR/MSR system - At the multilateral level, information on irregular migration is exchanged between Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine in the DSR/MSR system (Daily Statistics Reports/Monthly Statistics Reports). 
Information is delivered on a daily and monthly basis. 
EUROJUST investigation team - in this connection, an agreement on creating a joint investigation team between the General Prosecution of the SR and the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office of the Czech Republic was signed in August 2011 with a reference to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
In August 2012, the work of the joint investigation team terminated and the cooperation was evaluated as highly positive. 
An international organised group was revealed in the framework of this cooperation, and charges have been brought against nine persons. 
These persons arranged forged documents from forgers and handed them over mainly to migrants from Serbia and from other countries who got employed in EU countries with the help of such documents. 
The SR also regularly cooperates with Europol and Interpol. 
In the context of the fight against irregular migration, it is important to detect false and altered documents and ensure documents 
security. 
When receiving applications for a residence permit, the police department in the SR checks the validity and genuineness of documents: travel documents, ID cards, and support documentation (documents issued by the civil register office and other documents). 
The police departments use the following information systems to check the submitted travel documents and identification documents: 
ISSU LIGHT - German database of genuine and false travel documents, ID cards, residence permits, civil register office documents, and driving licences; 
IS FADO - national information system for false and genuine travel documents; and 
IS PRADO, IS iFADO - international information system containing specimens of genuine travel documents and other identity documents, visas and stamps of EU Member States and some third countries, and also brief information on the most important security elements of such documents. 
The police department also uses the Slovak and Czech database of lost and stolen travel documents. 
At the regional level, the SR uses a system on the basis of which a police officer who receives the application for a residence permit has a suspicion that the document he/she has received is forged, altered, invalid, stolen, etc. and is not able to confirm the genuineness thereof using technical and other means, he/ she would contact the appointed contact person (qualified to inspect documents) for the given region who is competent to prepare expert opinions in such cases. 
In 2012, the SR did not implement any regularisation mechanisms related to irregular migration. 
4.2 Return 
The Act on Residence of Aliens is the basic piece of legislation in this area. 
The new Act on Residence of Aliens which entered into effect on 01 January 2012 brought several changes to the returns agenda. 
In order to ensure full compatibility between the national legislation and European legislation in the field of return policy, the transposition of specific provisions of Directive 2008/ľi5/EC of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (Return Directive) has been modified. 
Compared to the previous provisions, the definition of administrative expulsion has been extended to the alien's obligation to leave to the EU Member State which has granted the residence permit in the case a decision on administrative expulsion has been made. 
With regard to the general provisions on administrative expulsion, the act has introduced the obligation to also state the country to which the alien is expelled in case it is not possible to determine that country, and to impose the prohibition of entry if the deadline for departure has not been determined. 
This right has a preventative nature and its purpose is to find out, by means of search, whether an alien holds items that could threaten the security of persons or property, or, for example, medicines he/she uses, but has forgotten to state this fact. 
A police officer is obliged to draw an official report on the search and a list of taken items, and gives a copy of the report to the alien. 
The police must return the withheld items after a decision on administrative expulsion has been made, if the alien has not been detained, except for financial resources used to cover the costs related to administrative expulsion and items the possession of which is contrary to the legislation of the SR. 
Another right introduced in the new act is the right to bring an alien to the police department. 
This new provision gives the police the right to bring an alien to the police department in case a police officer finds out, upon examining the alien's stay, facts that give grounds for administrative expulsion of the alien from the territory of the SR. 
The need to define this right in law has arisen from the practical application of the law, since the alien's personal presence in the administrative expulsion proceedings is inevitable. 
It is regarded an important procedural tool to ensure the course and purpose of the proceedings. 
The reasons for executing a decision on administrative expulsion of a third-country national by the police department have also been modified. 
The act also specifies the conditions under which such measures can be implemented. 
If the conditions are violated, the police department shall decide on the detention of the third-country national and on bail forfeiture if a bail has been given. 
The draft amendment to the Act on Residence of Aliens which is expected to enter into force on 01 May 2013 should bring further changes in this field, especially in respect of voluntary returns. 
In this context it should be noted that the SR also provides the possibility to take use of voluntary return. 
In the SR, the implementation of the Voluntary Returns Programme started with the signature of the Agreement of Cooperation between the Ministry of Interior of the SR and the International Organization for Migration of 20 August 1998 on Assistance in the Return of Rejected Asylum Applicants and Irregular Migrants to Their Countries of Origin. 
Besides this agreement, the Act on Residence of Aliens also constitutes a legal base for the execution of voluntary returns. 
In 2012, the help-line 0850 211 262 and a website on voluntary returns continued to operate. 
The IOM as project implementer has actively worked in asylum and detention facilities, and has informed the target group about the possibility of return to the country of origin and obtain post-return reintegration assistance. 
Through the anonymous helpline 0850, IOM employees provide callers with basic information about the return programme and individual consultations for aliens who have already participated in the programme. 
In 2012, 74 persons applied for voluntary return, and 54 returns were executed. 
The total number of reintegrations in the country of origin in 2012 reached 27. 
Most grants were provided to returnees from Vietnam, Moldova and Armenia. 
Returnees are mostly interested in material assistance in the form of reconstruction of houses and flats, or purchase of household accessories or motorcycles (15 cases). 
In eight cases, assistance was granted to start business, either through entry into partnership with an established company, or on an individual basis. 
Complex coverage of personal needs of third-country nationals in police detention facilities for aliens within the SR - the main objective of the project is to ensure appropriate and decent conditions for third-country nationals by providing basic, supplementary and accompanying services and overall facilitation of their stay in the police detention facilities for aliens (PDFAs) in Medveďov and Sečovce. 
The project activities mainly focus on social care and counselling, health care and psychological care, including care for vulnerable groups of persons, measures to satisfy other special needs of persons who need special care, and provision of material assistance. 
103 The statistical data was provided by IOM. 
The training courses improved the qualification of a total of 527 participants - BBAP PFP staff who are involved in the management and execution of returns within the SR. 
Foreign language training for the Border and Aliens Police staff (English, Russian, Vietnamese, Chinese) - the project objective is to improve language proficiency in English, Russian, Chinese and Vietnamese among the police who directly communicate with thirdcountry nationals. 
With regard to returns, the SR also develops cooperation at the international level through joint air return operations where it has so far acted exclusively in the position of a participating country given the current number and citizenship of the target group of third-country nationals as subjects of return at the respective moment according to the national legislation109, or through the Voluntary Return European Network (VREN). 
The activities of the network were launched in January 2012. 
The project was prepared by the IOM together with 15 EU Member States110 and with EC support. 
The project seeks to create a Voluntary Return European Network with the cooperation of 27 Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the main countries of transit and origin. 
All stakeholders have access to the web platform which serves for information exchange, sharing and coordination among the individual partners. 
The platform can also respond to various queries by VREN network users through two parallel interfaces-one for registered members and another one for the general public. 
Table 5 in Annex 2 presents an overview of executed forced returns and voluntary returns in the SR in 2012. 
International Protection including Asylum 
In 2012, the declining trend in the number of submitted asylum applications changed, as this number increased to 732 in 2012 compared to 2011 and the year before. 
In 2012, the procedure was suspended in 334 cases, which represents an increase compared to 2011 when asylum was rejected in 186 cases. 
Table 6 in Annex 2 provides an overview of the trends in asylum policy from 2009 to 2012. 
In 2012, asylum applicants from Somalia represented again one of the most numerous nationalities of asylum applicants in the SR. 
In this regard, the MO MoI SR raised an ad-hoc query within EMN concerning Member States policies for the assessment of asylum applications and returns of applicants from Somalia with the aim to obtain new experience and apply it in practice. 
The received information was mainly used in the appeal procedures at courts, though it should be considered only as complementary information, as each case is assessed individually. 
In 2012, no legislative changes occurred in the field of international protection. 
Changes are presumed to happen in 2013 when the amended Act on Residence of Aliens is expected to enter into force on 01 May 2013, amending inter alia the Act on Asylum and other laws of the SR (e.g. Act on Administrative Fees, Civil

05. International Protection including Asylum 
Procedure Code, Police Force Act, Act on Court Seats and Court Districts. 
This amendment aims to transpose into the legislation of the SR Directive 2011/51/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 amending Council Directive 2003/109/EC to extend its reach to beneficiaries of international protection. 
The changes in the Act on Asylum should modify the provisions on the solution of problems that occur during the asylum granting procedure. 
Among other things, it is proposed to extend the reasons for the cancellation of asylum and suspension of the asylum procedure, change the conditions for the cancellation of subsidiary protection, and extend the reasons for the cancellation thereof. 
114 A special legislative process will be used to change the Act on Employment Services which is expected to cancel the need to hold an employment permit for persons under subsidiary protection, and to classify this group of aliens as disadvantaged job seekers. 
Just as other areas of migration, international protection is also a subject of MP Action Plans. 
The individual measures are continuously implemented in the context of the new EU legislation and policies under preparation (for more details see sub-chapter 5.1) and cooperation within EASO (for more details refer to sub-chapter 5.2) and with other associations and groups. 
In 2012, the SR had the first opportunity to test the use of language analyses; the first five analyses were made through the GDISC remote interpreting project in cooperation with Malta. 
Language analyses were also conducted with applicants from Somalia as the country of origin. 
At regional level, we should mention the exchange of information and practical experience in asylum issues by means of personal 
Bilateral cooperation also contributes to the enhancement of national capacities related to the countries of origin, mainly through joint training activities and exchange of practical experience (e.g. individually in cooperation with the Czech Republic, Finland or Latvia). 
The ENARO network (European Network of Asylum Reception Organisations) also contributes to the enhancement of national capacities through practical cooperation in the field of asylum. 
The MO MoI SR was accepted as ENARO member in 2009, and has been successfully involved in expert exchanges of workers ensuring reception of asylum applicants in asylum facilities (the last visit was paid by a representative of the Hungarian Office for Immigration and Nationality on 07-19 October 2012; the topic of the visit was the relations of the reception centre with the local community). 
The festival visitors were informed about the migration policy of the SR, trafficking in human beings, and also about social work and legal counselling provided in asylum facilities with an emphasis on vulnerable groups. 
Many festival visitors addressed the desk with specific questions, and discussed and positively evaluated the presence of a state institution at this event and the willingness to speak openly about these issues with the festival visitors. 
5.1 Common European Asylum System 
The package of directives as part of the Common European Asylum System is at different stages of approval at European level. 
The SR has been actively involved in all negotiations on the individual proposals for the asylum package and has been raising comments. 
The transposition of the individual directives at the national level is expected in the period 2013-14 at the earliest. 
Better quality of life for all IV - the project focuses on an overall improvement of the situation and quality of life of asylum applicants staying in the asylum facility in Rohovce in Western Slovakia and in the police detention facility for aliens in Medveďov through the provision of basic, supplementary and accompanying services (social care and counselling, health care and psychological care, legal counselling and assistance, training, language preparation, and also material assistance, interpreting and translations). 
These services are also provided by asylum applicants who took up employment or entered a similar employment relationship and who can be accommodated outside of asylum facilities. 
The project seeks to provide legal, social and psychological counselling and assistance, as well as training activities (Slovak language training, general education and promotion of working skills),

116 For more information see www.sldv.sk (consulted on 28/11/2012). 
As of today, the SR has not requested support by EASO (deployment of a support team to Slovakia). 
5.3 Intra-EU Solidarity including Relocation 
The SR has become a partner country, through the MO MoI SR, to the pilot project of internal relocation of persons under international protection in Malta (EUREMA). 
The Partnership Declaration was signed on 14 December 2009. 
Under the EUREMA project, the SR committed itself to receive from Malta ten persons under international protection, these being families and single parents with children. 
In spite of the effort by the SR, this commitment was not fulfilled. 
In 2011, the EC decided to extent the project. 
The second stage of EUREMA II project was launched in January 2012 and is expected to last until the middle of 2013. 
The project will continue to be financed from ERF funds, and the Member States involved in the project (SR, Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania) plan to relocate 91 persons in total. 
The SR reiterated its commitment to accept ten persons. 
The persons under international protection in Malta have not shown any interest in being relocated to the SR in this project stage as well. 
5.4 Cooperation with Third Countries including Resettlement 
44 Afghani refugees from Iran (12 families - 26 mothers and 18 children) came to the SR on 19 April 2012. 
On 21 June 2012, the Government of the SR, the UNHCR and the IOM signed a new trilateral agreement on the humanitarian transfer through the Slovak Republic of refugees who need international protection in effect from 24 June 2012. 
Under this agreement, the SR received 50 refugees (27 adults and 23 children) from Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, Iraq and Eritrea on 19 July 2012. 
On 09 October 2012, the SR received a group of 51 persons from Somalia, 30 of them being children. 
All these cases concern refugees who are gradually resettled to third countries. 
During their stay, the MO MoI SR provides these persons with complex services, accommodation, food and basic hygienic needs. 
The costs incurred in connection with their stay are partly covered from the ERF funds; health and social care for refugees is provided by the UNHCR, and the transfer as such is ensured by the IOM. 
The SR in light of cooperation with third countries in this area supports all activities that could help relieve the situation in Syria and in the neighbouring regions. 
The SR also supports the creation of regional programmes of protection for the most affected countries of the region and all actions aimed to prevent possible secondary movements of refugees. 
117 These information and statistics were provided by the MO MoI SR. 
Unaccompanied Minors and Other Vulnerable Groups 
This chapter presents an overview of measures concerning care for unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable groups, either in the national or the EU context. 
Given the fact that this group of persons is very small in Slovakia, the mass media do not report on this issue and no public discussions are conducted. 
The cooperation is run at the expert level, in particular through projects financed by the EU. 
All measures of legislative and political nature related to this field were implemented in the previous periods, as a consequence of which no important developments in this area were reported in 2012. 
6.1 Unaccompanied Minors 
Seven countries, including Slovakia, have been involved in the project: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, and Hungary. 
In the first stage, national reports on guardianship in each of these countries were compiled. 
The second project stage focused on the training of trainers for the purpose of national training courses for guardians. 
The third project stage represented national training courses for guardians and people working with unaccompanied minors, and compilation of a training manual. 
ties of the MO MoI SR, employees of relevant foster homes, and guardians who are employees of the competent labour offices. 
The training was divided into several main blocks: international law aspects; national legislation; trafficking in human beings; personal skills of people working with unaccompanied minors; the psychological aspects of work with unaccompanied minors; exchange of experience among actors working in this area, etc. 
Upon the initiative of the director of the foster home for unaccompanied minors, the MO MoI SR organised a working meeting on this topic in June 2012. 
Besides representatives of the foster home for unaccompanied minors in Horné Orechové and the MO MoI SR (including camp managers and social workers), the meeting was also attended by representatives of COLSAF, MoLSAF SR and nongovernmental organisations. 
The participants to the meeting discussed current problems and issues, for example, the differing regimes for minors in foster homes and facilities of the MO MoI SR, or trafficking in human beings in cases where there is a suspicion that a minor person has become the victim of such crime. 
In September 2012, a small thematic meeting of the representatives of selected entities working in the field of migration and asylum was organised in the framework of EMN activities. 
The meeting was also attended by entities working with unaccompanied minors. 
The discussion on the current and long-term practical issues related to care for clients in the field of asylum and migration was based on case reports provided by non-governmental organisations and COLSAF guardians upon request by the MO MoI SR. 
Unaccompanied minors are paid special attention in the ASAP III project funded from ERF which focuses on the social and economic integration of aliens with asylum and subsidiary protection into the general population in Slovakia with special emphasis on vulnerable persons. 
Since care for unaccompanied minors falls under the competence of the local offices of labour, social affairs and family which ensure their basic living needs through foster homes, the support offered through the ASAP III project only has a complementary nature. 
The project therefore puts emphasis on the provision of social and psychological counselling. 
The provision of social counselling mainly consists of giving information on actual life after leaving the foster home and bringing clients' expectations and possibilities closer to reality. 
With regard to the implementation of the AZYL. 
SK IV project (see also sub-chapter 5.1), main emphasis is put on vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied minors. 
Social workers meet them since the first day of their entry into the asylum procedure, and provide them with counselling and assistance, thus creating more personal ties than in the case of guardians or decision-makers. 
The project also includes cooperation with a psychologist who can, together with social workers, provide better orientation to minors and set out more realistic aims for the next period. 
The project also supports the development of their skills and talent through art therapy within the possibilities available to asylum facilities.

Annual Report on Migration and Asylum Policies 2012 - Slovak Republic 
The project AZYL. 
SK IV provides legal assistance to asylum applicants in Central and Eastern Slovakia with an accent on vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied minor asylum applicants (legal representation has so far been secured in 100 per cent of all cases). 
Lawyers are present already at the making of a statement at the police authorities, and subsequently they represent the minors until termination of the asylum procedure. 
They carry out all legal acts they are entitled to under the legislation. 
The issues concerning unaccompanied minors were also dealt by the EASO at a specific meeting also with the representatives of the SR. 
These two documents should offer to the Member States guidance on how to proceed with unaccompanied minors, especially with regard to age determination. 
Future changes concerning unaccompanied minors are expected to be made in the period 2013-14 at the earliest. 
Table 7 in Annex 2 provides an overview of the numbers of unaccompanied minors in the SR in 2012. 
SK IV project (information about the project is also provided in sub-chapters 5.1 and 6.1) were also used to ensure protected housing for disadvantaged persons in the asylum facility Opatovská Nová Ves in the period from December 2011 to February 2012. 
Protected housing consists of independent housing units-tworoom studio apartments with their own sanitary facilities. 
The layout of the apartments allows variable accommodation of different types of clients according to the nature of their handicap (social, psychical or health). 
At the same time, it is the only facility with a barrier-free design among accommodation centres for asylum applicants within the SR, thus enabling access for clients with motion disorders (patients suffering monoparesis or paraplegia), as well as for clients with moderate up to medium spastic and non-spastic disabilities (DMO). 
Clients evaluated their involvement in building works highly positive, and this activity has also contributed to the promotion of their working habits and skills. 
The meaningful use of the time of clients has also had a positive effect on their psychical conditions and on the elimination of stress and conflict situations among individual groups. 
The opening of the possibilities for personal self-realisation of clients appeared to be a strong socialising incentive, and the involvement in building works largely increased the self-confidence of clients and their feeling of satisfaction from self-realisation.
